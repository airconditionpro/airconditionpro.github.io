<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Temple City CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
