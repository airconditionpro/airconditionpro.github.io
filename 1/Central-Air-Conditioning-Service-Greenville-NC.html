<h3>Furnace Cost in Greenville NC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual events.<p>
