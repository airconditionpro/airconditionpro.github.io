<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Climax NC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
