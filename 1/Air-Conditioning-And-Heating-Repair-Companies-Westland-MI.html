<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they ought to be put. A lot of frequently they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals primarily stay seated in that specific area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what toxin you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensing unit accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
