Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
