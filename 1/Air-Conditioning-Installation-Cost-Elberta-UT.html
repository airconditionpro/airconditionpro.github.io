<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
