<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled.

Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
