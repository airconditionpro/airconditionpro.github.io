<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Nyack NY</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
