<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great concept to think about energy performance. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Performance ratings need to be identified with all systems. While efficient units might cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated device is a fantastic way to delight in extra comfort.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
