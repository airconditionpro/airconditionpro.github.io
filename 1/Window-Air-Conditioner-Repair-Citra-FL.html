<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
