He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually met in a long period of time.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
