<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider.

New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
