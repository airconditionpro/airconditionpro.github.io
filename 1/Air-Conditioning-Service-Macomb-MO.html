Residential systems can even more improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
