What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
