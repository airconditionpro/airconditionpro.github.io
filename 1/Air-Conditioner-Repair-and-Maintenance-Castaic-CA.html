<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
