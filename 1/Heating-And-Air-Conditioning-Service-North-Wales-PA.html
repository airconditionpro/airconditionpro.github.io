<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical earnings for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
