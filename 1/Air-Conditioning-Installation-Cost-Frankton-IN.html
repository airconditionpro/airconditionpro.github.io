Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
