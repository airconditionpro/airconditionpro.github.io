<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health effects discussed.

Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could happen.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
