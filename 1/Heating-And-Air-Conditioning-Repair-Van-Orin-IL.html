<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, compressor, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which usually is placed on a roofing or on a concrete piece beside the house's foundation. This kind of air conditioner also is utilized in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the house's outside wall or roof to connect with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is typically located outdoors.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
