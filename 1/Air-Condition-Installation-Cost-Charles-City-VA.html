<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less frequent (but often more serious) cases of people becoming ill after being in a particular structure at a specific time. In these cases, there is usually a similar set of scientific signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be found upon examination. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can contaminate a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately closed down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Old heaters typically begin to make some unusual sounds as they get toward the end of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching sounds coming from your furnace? Another sound is when you hear the furnace blower running exceedingly. These noises are triggered by a range of problems like unsecured ductwork, motor failure, an unbalanced motor or degrading parts. Does your blower turn on and off frequently or does it blow cold air often? This is a sign that your furnace might require to be replaced if so.<p>
