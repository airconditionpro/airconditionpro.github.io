<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Truth That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating Method in Dearborn MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
