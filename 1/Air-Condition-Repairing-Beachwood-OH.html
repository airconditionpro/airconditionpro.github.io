<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
