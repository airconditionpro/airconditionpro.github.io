<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
