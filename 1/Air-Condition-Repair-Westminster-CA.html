<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
