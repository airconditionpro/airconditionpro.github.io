<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's performance. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
