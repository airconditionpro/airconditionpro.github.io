<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production combines quality products and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling items all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning unit there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the space.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
