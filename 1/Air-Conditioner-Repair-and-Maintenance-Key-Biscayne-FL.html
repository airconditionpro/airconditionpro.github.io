<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The payback for a system can range from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, nearly double a conventional system.
