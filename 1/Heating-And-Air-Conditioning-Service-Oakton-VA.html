<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
