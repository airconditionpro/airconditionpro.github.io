<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes because a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and household items, are similar. Indoor air problems comparable to those in offices are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, poorly put outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>
