<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are pointed out here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
