<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Millsap TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
