<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider.
