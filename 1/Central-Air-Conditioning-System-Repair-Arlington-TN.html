<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Arlington TN</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
