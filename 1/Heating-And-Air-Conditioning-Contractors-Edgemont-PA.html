<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or positioned in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.
