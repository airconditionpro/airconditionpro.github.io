<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen clings to your hair and clothing where it can quickly aggravate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air pollution. Don't have time for a fast rinse?

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is connected with a higher occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Exposure Evaluation Approach (TEAM) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outdoors, despite whether the homes were located in rural or extremely industrial locations. Extra GROUP research studies indicate that while individuals are utilizing products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.<p>
