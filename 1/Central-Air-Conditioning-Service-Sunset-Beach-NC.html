<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly hard for your lungs to function appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
