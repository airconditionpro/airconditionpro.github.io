<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust.

<p>We look at ideas prior to we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
