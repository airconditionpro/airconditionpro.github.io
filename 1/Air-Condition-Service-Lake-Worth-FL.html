<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Lake Worth FL?</h3>

<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Lake Worth FL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the concern and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
