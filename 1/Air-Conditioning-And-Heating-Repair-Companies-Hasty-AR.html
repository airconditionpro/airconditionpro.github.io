<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. Often it's not a major issue, and your system may just require some maintenance work.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
