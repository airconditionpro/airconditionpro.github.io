<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

Honestly, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the consisted of hardware and fasteners.
