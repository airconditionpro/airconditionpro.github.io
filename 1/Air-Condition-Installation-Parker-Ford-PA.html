<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Parker Ford PA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to purchase it. My other half said that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a very long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
