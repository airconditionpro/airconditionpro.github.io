Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
