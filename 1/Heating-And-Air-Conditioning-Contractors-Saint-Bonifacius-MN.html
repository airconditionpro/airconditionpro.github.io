<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a vicious, terrible summer season.<p>
