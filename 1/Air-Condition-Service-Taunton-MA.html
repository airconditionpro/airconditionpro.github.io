<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
