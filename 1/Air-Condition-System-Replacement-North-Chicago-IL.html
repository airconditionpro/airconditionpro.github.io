<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.
