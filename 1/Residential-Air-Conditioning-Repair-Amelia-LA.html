<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be appropriate.<p>
