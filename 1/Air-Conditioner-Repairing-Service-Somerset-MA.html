<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
