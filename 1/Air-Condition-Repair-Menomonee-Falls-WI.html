<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
