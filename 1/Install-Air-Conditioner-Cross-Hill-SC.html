<p>Today's house radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, but might become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
