<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an efficiency greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a good idea to consider energy efficiency. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an effectiveness score as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Performance ratings should be labeled with all units. While effective units might cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated home appliance is a great way to take pleasure in extra comfort.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure."

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
