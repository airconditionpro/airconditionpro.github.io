<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone.
