<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
