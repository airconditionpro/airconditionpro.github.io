An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty.

He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
