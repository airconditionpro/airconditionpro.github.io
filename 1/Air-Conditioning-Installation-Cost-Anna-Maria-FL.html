<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less frequent (but typically more severe) cases of people becoming ill after remaining in a particular building at a particular time. In these cases, there is normally a comparable set of medical signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by germs which can pollute a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
