<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
