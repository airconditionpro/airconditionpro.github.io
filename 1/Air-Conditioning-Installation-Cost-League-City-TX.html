<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.

Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
