This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air.
