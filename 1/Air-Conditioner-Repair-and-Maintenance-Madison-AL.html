This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
