<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
