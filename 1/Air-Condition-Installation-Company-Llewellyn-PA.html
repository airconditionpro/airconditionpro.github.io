<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
