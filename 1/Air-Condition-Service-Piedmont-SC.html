<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
