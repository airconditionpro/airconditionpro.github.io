<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
