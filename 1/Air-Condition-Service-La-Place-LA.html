<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
