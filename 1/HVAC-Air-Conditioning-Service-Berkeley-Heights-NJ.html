<h3>How To Eradicate Boiler Issues in Berkeley Heights NJ</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems need to be examined at least two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
