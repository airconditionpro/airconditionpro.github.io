<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
