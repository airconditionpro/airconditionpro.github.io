<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to evaluate and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses.

<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.
