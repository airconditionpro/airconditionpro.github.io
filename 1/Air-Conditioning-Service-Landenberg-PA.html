<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
