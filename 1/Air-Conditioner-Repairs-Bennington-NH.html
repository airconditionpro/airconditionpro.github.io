<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
