<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
