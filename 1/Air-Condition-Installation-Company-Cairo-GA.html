<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually handled the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and expert.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
