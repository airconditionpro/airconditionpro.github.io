<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Licking MO</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might activate attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has likewise been shown to trigger cancer in animals and might cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
