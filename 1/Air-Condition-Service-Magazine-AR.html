<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
