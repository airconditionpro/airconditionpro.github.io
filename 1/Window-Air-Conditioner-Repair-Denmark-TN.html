<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
