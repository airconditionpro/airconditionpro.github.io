When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
