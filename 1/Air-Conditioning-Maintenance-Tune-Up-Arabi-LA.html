<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
