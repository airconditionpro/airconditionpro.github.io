<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services at South Jordan UT</h3>

These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
