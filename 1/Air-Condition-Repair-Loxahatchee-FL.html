<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Loxahatchee FL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water checked. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
