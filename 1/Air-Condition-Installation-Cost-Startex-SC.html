<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
