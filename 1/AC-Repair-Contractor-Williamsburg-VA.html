<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Williamsburg VA</h3>
<p>Most people know that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, hazardous result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top 5 environmental health threats to the public.<p>

Improper modification, often suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you acquire a brand-new gas stove or variety, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
