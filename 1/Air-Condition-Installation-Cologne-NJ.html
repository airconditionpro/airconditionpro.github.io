<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Cologne</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, just including refrigerant is not a service. An experienced technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
