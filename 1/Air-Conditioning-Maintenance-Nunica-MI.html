However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is eliminated.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
