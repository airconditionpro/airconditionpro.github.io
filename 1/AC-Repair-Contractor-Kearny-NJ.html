<p>Chemical pollutants: Unstable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a vicious, cruel summertime.<p>
