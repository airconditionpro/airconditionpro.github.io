Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Hernando MS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units feature a variety of unique features that can even more improve efficiency and effectiveness. For example, house owners may want to look for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to minimize energy expenses a lot more. Of course, more features imply greater central air costs.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
