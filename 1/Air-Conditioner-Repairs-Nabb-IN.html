<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
