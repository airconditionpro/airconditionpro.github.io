<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
