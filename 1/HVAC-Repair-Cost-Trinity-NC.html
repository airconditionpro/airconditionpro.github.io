<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>If you operate in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands.

Soil by roadways and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to entering the home. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, alter your clothing before you go house and wash these clothes individually. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and ensure they wash their hands when they come within.<p>

<p>Inspect these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
