Pressed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is normally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>

The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.

The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
