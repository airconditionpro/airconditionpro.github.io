<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
