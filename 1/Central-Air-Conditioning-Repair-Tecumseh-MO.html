<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or just a high level of competitors for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>In Tecumseh 2019 figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a typical wage of $21.89 per hour for HVAC service technicians, or $45,540 per year based on 40-hour weeks. The overall wage range is large, with the lowest-paid 10 percent of HVAC technicians earning $12.89 per hour or less, and the highest-paid 10 percent earning $33.10 per hour or more. Annualized incomes vary from under $26,810 to over $68,840 annually, with the average falling at $43,380. Real-world incomes can be greater, if the technician works significant overtime.<p>
