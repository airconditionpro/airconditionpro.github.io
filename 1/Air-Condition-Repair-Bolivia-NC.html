While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior.

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 1 month during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees.
