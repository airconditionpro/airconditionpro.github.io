<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
