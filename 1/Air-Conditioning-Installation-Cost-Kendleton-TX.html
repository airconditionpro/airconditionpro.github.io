<p>Measurement procedures are being established and demonstrated to assess structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These treatments vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches utilized mainly in constructing research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be used by constructing operators.

<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
