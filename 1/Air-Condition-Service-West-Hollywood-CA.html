<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at West Hollywood CA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
