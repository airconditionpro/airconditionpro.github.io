<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if required, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
