<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Greenwood TX - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
