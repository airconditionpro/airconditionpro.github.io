<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
