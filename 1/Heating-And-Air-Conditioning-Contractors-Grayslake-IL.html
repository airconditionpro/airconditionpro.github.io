<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
