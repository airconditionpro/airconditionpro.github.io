<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
