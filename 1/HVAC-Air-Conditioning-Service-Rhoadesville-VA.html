<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
