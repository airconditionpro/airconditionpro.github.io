<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, a lot of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
