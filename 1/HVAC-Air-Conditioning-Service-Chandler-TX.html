<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
