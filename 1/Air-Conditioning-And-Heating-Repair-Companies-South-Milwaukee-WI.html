<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
