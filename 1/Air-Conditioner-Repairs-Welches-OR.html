<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level.
