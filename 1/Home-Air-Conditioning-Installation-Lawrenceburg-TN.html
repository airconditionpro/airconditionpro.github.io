<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
