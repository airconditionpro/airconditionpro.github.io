Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
