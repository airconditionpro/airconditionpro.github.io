<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the flow of air.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
