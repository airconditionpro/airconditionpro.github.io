<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
