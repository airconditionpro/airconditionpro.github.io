<p>We look at hints prior to we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
