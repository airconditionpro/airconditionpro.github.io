<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.
