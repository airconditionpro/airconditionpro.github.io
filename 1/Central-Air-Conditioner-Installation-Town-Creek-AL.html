<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically brought on by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations carried out in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is essential in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
