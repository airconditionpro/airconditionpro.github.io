Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
