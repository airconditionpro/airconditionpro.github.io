<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
