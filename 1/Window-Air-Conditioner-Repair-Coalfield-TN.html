<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
