"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.
