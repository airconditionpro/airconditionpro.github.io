<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
