<p>Many individuals undervalue the extent of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is normally pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the house.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
