<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
