All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
