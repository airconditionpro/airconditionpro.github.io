<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically develop in ductwork, limiting airflow. Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really difficult at first, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and know-how.

Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, changing a furnace and checking filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
