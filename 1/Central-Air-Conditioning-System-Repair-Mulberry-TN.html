<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>

According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher.
