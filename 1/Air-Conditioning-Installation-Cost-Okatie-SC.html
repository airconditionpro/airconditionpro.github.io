<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
