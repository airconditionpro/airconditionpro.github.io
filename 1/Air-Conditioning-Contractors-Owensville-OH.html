All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining properly. A restriction in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are several locations an obstruction can happen. One of the primary locations where clogs start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
