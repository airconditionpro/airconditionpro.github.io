<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
