<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Wasco IL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
