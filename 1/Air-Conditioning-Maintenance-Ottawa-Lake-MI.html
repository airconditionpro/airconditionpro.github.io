<p>Although installation is simple and does not require much time, attempting this task is not a great idea.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing or on a concrete slab next to the house's foundation.

Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the home's outside wall or roofing to connect with the packaged a/c unit, which is normally situated outdoors. Packaged a/c often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning unit and central heating unit removes the requirement for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
