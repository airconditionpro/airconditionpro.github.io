<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
