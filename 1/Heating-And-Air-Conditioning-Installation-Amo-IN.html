<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
