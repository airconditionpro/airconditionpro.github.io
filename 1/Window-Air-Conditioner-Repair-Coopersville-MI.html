<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Coopersville MI</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may activate attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some people can establish a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
