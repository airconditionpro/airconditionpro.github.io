<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
