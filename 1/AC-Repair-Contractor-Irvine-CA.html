<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Company in Irvine</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
