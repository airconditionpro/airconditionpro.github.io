<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
