<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
