<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
