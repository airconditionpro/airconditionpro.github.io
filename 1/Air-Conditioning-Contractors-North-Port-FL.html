<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
