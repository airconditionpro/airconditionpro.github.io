<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Consumer items that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
