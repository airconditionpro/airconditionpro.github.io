There are several design techniques in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable principles. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be infected (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread pollutants from one portion of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can assist reduce these problems.<p>

<p>New air conditioners typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score means greater energy performance and possibly lower energy expenses.

<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow property owners to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in home to conserve money on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overloaded. An expert technician will examine the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to guarantee the actual temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature, the technician needs to check the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the entire HVAC system.<p>
