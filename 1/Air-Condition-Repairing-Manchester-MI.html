<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>

I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
