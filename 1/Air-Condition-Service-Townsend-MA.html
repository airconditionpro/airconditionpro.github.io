Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
