<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
