<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
