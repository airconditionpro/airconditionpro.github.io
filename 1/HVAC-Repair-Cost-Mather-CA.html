<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
