My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have become fairly adept at researching products on line prior to acquiring them. However I do not discover that there is a central location for searching details about the "true" value of home HVAC systems or possibly I should state a truthful assessment of these items. Due to the fact that they are really taxed in the summer, considering that I live in FL it is important to have an excellent AC unit in your house.<p>
