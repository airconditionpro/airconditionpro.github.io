<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
