People might complain of several of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness; nausea; irritability and lapse of memory. Poor lighting, sound, vibration, thermal pain, and psychological stress might also cause, or contribute to, these symptoms.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
