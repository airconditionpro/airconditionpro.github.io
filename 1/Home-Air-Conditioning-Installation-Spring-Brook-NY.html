<p>. Before picking the installation location of a/c unit, numerous primary aspects require to be considered. Firstly, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there should not be any challenges en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
