<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
