<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one reaction specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
