<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
