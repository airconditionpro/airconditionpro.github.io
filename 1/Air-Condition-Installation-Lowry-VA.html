<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer must examine measurements of humidity, air and temperature level circulation. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for developing use and tenancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be helpful. Leakages require to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become polluted with germs or fungis and need to be removed, likewise. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.
