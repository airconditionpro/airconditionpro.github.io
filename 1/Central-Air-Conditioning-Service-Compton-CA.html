<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco items; building products and home furnishings as diverse as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or moist carpet, and cabinetry or furniture made from specific pressed wood products; items for household cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your company must check measurements of temperature level, air and humidity circulation. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for building usage and occupancy) must be performed. A structure walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings may be practical. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with bacteria or fungi and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
