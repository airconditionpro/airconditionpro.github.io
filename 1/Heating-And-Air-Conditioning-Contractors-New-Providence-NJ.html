Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
