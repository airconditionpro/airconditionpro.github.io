<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
