<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot.

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
