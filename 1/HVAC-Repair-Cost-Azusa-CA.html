The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.
