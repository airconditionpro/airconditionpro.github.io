<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
