<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
