<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
