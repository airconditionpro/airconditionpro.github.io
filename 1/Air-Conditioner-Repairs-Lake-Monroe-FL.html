Likewise known as mini divides" or split level ACs," ductless Air conditionings can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that comes with conventional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
