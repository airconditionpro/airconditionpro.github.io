<p>Typically the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
