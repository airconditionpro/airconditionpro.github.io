<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
