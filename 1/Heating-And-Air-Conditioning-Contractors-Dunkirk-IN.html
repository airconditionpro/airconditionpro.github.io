<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
