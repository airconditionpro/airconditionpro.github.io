<p>We look at ideas before we supply advice to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
