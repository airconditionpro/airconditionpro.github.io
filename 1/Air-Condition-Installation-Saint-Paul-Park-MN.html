Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
