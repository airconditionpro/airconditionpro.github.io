Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
