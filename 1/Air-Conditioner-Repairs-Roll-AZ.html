<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
