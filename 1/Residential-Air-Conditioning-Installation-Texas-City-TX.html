<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
