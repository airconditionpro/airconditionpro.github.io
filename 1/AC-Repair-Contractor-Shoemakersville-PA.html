<p>The purpose of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is described as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house likewise depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
