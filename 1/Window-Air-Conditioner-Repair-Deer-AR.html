<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
