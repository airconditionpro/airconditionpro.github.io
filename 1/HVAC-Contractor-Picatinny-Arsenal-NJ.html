The very best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned completely before colder seasons start. Always make sure that the furnace is tidied up each year to avoid soot and condensation which causes burners to stop working effectively. If your furnace remains in a very poor condition, perhaps it is time to begin thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
