Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are normally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
