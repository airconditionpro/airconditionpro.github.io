Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
