<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
