<h3>Air Condition Service in Salem Michigan</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan does not. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
