<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%.

Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
