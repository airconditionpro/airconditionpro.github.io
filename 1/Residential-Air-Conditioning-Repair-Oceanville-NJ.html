<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperatures in shops to save on costs (particularly at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops change beyond an appropriate range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.)
