<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
