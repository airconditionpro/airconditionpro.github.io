I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly.
