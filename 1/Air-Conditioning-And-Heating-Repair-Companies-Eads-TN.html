<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
