<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Walnut IL</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is stopped up or dirty Before trying to fix any issue, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is great to go, inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, call a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
