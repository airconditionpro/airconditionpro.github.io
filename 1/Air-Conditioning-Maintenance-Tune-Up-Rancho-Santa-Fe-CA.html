<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
