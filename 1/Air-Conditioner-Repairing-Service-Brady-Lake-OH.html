<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually.

In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
