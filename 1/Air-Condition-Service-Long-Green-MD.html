<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is necessary not only for employees' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular diseases have been connected to specific air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with moist indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can cause cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or COP. It's a scientific way of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every system of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>

In warm or damp climates, maintaining thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
