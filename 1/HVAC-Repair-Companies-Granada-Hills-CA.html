You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining properly. A constraint in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are various places an obstruction can happen. Among the primary areas where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
