<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the establishing world.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
