<h3>Powerful Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Highland CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
