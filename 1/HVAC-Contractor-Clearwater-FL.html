<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Often, specific contaminants like dust from construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>
