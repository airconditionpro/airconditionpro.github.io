<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids may have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
