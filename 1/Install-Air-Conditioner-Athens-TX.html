<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Athens TX</h3>
<p>Sean was really useful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
