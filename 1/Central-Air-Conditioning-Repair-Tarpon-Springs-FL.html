<p>A geothermal heating system is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
