<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as altering somewhat in time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned up, collects dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>

<p>In some cases, however, building occupants experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are tough to trace to any specific phenomenon has been labeled ill structure syndrome. People may experience several of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or sleepiness; headache; dizziness; nausea; irritability and lapse of memory. Poor lighting, noise, vibration, thermal discomfort, and psychological stress might also cause, or contribute to, these symptoms.<p>
<p>If you have a large home, a house with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air may not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well encouraged to perform a house energy audit to assess where improvements might be made to increase the effectiveness of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could really accumulate and possibly minimize your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and keep.<p>
