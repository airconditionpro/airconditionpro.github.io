<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
