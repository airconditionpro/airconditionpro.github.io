<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed.

He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater seems less like a luxury item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a major renovation task, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heater is an appropriate option for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
