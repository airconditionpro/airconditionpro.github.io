<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a cruel, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
