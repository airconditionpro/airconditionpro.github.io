The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
