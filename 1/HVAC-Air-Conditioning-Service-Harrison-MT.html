Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
