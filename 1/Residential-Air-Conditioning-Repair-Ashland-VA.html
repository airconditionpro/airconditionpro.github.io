<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
