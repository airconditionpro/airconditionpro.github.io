As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
