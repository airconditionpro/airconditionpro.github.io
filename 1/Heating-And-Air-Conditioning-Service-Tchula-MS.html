<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
