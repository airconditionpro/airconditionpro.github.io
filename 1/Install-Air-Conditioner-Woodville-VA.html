<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the maker's guarantee.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
