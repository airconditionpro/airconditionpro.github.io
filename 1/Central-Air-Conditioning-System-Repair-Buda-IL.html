<p>A health questionnaire should be developed and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool needs to recognize the number of individuals affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health signs or health problems; recognize all devices operated in the work environment; show the kind of outside air pollution; and recognize prospective sources of job stress.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
