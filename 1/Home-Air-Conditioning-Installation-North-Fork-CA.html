<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
