<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
