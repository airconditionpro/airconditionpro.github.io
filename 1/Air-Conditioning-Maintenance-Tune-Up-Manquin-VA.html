Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

Children might have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
