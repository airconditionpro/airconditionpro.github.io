<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Strongsville Ohio</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Strongsville OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
