Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
