<p>In many cases, if materials have failed to dry out numerous days after the believed water occasion, mold growth is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable. Through a mold examination, which may include harmful examination, one should be able to figure out the existence or absence of mold. In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold remediation might be required. Mold screening and assessments must be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to guarantee precise outcomes; complimentary mold screening provided by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>
