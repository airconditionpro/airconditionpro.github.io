<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
