<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
