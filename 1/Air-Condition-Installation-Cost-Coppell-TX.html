<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
