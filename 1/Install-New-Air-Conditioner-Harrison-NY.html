<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
