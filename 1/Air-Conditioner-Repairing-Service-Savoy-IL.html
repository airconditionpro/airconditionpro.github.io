<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Savoy Illinois</h3>
<p>Some HVAC technicians sell service contracts to their customers, supplying regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some instances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to help repair or install cooling and heating systems. For instance, on a large cooling installation job, especially one in which employees are covered by union contracts, ductwork might be done by sheet metal employees and duct installers, or electrical work by electrical contractors Repairs to household refrigerators or window air conditioning unit are often performed by house appliance repair services versus HVAC professionals.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to keeping an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
