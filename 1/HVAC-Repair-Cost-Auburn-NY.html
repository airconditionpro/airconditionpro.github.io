<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
