<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities.

For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

The 2 operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
