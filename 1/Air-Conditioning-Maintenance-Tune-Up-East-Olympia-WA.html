<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high expenses. Furnaces often lose their effectiveness as they age, specifically if they have not been properly maintained. As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to provide the same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month might be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a considerable difference.<p>
