Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
