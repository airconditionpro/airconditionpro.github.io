<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can mean significant savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

Perera stated one advantage of being larger is the ability to utilize the company's size to get the best costs on everything from insurance to lorries.<p>
