<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an acceptable range that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
