In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
