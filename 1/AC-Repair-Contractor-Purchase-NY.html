<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
