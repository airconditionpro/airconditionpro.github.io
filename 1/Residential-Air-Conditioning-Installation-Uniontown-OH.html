<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the biggest energy customers in your home, so homeowners who may be looking for a brand-new furnace should considering changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to conserve cash and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a considerable investment in your house. Invest wisely by finding out as much as you can about offered alternatives.<p>
