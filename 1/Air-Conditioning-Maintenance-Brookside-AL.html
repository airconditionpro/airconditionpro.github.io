I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public destinations.
