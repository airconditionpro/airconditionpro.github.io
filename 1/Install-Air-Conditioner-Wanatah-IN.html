<p>There are lots of things to take into account when attempting to figure out how often I should replace my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them.
