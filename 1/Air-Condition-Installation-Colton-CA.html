<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
