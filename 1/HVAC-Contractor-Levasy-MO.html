<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
