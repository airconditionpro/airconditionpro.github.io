<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really experienced. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was obviously affordable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
