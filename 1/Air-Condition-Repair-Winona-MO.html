<p>When the level of new building and construction activity declines, service technicians who specialize in brand-new installation work may experience durations of joblessness.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
