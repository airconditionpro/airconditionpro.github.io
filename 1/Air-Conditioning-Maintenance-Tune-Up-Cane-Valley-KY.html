<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
