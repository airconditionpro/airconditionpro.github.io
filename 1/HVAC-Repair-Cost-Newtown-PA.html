<h3>Central Heating System in Newtown PA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild results that are often incorrect for the flu. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The impacts of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
