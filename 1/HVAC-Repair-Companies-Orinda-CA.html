<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Orinda CA Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
