<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>

The number of hours it takes typically triggers the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a new one would be. If you change a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, consider anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin since they have the very best heat exchanger warranties in the industry on their top furnaces.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
