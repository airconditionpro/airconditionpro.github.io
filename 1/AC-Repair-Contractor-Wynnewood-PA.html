<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time.

Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
