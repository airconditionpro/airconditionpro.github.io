<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the prospective to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Palm Desert California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
