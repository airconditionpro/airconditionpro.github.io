<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
