To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely effective, beating out most other types of heater in performance.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
