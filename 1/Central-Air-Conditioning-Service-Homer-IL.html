<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
