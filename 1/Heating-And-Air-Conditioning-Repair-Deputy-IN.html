<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
