If we had the opportunity to make informed choices, and some are threats we might choose to prevent. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
