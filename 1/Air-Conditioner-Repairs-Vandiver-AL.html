<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Vandiver AL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
