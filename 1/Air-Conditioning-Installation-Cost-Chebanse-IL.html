<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
