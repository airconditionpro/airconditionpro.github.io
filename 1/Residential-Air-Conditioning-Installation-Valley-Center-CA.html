According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly efficient gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
