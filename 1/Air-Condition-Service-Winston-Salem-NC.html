<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Winston Salem NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
