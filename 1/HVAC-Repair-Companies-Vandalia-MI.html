On those days when you simply can't appear to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this problem due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not trust fans, ducts, registers and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heater can lower the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your home.<p>
