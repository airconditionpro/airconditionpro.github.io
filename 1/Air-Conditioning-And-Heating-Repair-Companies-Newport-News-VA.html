Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking cigarettes, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters.

<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration.

The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
