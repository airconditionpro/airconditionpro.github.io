<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad.

Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly.
