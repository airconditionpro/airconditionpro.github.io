<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Wittmann AZ</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
