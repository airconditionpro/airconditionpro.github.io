<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors.

(Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
