<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.

When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>For instance, problems occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate quantities of outside air.

Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
