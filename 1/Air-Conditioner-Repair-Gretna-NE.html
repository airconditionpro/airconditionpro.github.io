(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
