<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years.
