<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
