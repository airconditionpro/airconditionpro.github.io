From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
