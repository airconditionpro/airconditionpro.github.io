<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
