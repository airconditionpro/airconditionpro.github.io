<p>Specialist heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.
