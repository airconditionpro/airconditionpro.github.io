A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
