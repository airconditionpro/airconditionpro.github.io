<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
