<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
