<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is devoted to supplying a work environment that is devoid of recognized threats and to examination problems that might be related to poor indoor air quality (IAQ). Though particular regulations have not been established for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) thinks about recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>
