<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
