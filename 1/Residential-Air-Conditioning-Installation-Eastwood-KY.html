<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
