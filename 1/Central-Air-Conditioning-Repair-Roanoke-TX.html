<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
