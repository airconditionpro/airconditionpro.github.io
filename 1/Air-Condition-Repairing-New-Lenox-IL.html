<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
