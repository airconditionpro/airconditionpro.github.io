<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Theodore AL</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
