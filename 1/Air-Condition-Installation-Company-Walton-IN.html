<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
