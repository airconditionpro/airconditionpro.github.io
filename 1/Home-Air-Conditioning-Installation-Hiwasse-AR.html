<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
