<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
