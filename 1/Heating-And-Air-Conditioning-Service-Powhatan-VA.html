Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
