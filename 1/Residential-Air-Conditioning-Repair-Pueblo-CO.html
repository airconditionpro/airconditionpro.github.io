Their techs are professional and very well-informed. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week.

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.
