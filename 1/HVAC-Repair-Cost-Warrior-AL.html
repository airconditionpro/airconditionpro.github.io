We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<h3>Furnace Replacement in Warrior Alabama</h3>
<p>You rely on your cooling system to perform at maximum efficiency when you require it the most, and when your system breaks, you need professional aid quickly-- particularly in the hot summer seasons of the Midwest. At 4 Seasons Heating and A/c, our AC repair experts are available day or night to offer you with timely, premium services that restore your system back to working order.

<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated up in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thereby cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply constant and reliable heating and cooling.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, think about purchasing an energy-efficient design. Look for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems are about 15% more efficient than basic designs. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the effectiveness requirements for central air conditioners for information, and consider buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for higher cost savings.<p>
