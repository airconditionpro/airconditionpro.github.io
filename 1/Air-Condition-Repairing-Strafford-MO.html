<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution.

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company.

Review of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
