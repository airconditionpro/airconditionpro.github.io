<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
