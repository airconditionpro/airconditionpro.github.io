<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To identify odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
