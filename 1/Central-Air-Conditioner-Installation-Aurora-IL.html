<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
