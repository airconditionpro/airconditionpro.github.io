<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Casnovia MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
