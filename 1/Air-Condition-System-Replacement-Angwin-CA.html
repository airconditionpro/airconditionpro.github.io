<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
