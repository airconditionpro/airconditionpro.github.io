<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
