Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
