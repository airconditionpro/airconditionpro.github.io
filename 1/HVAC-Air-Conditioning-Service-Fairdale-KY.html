<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
