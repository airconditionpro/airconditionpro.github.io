<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
