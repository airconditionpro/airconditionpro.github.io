<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to rise and stream out high building openings to the outdoors (stack result ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, but care needs to be taken to guarantee comfort. In humid or warm environments, maintaining thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise use outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>
