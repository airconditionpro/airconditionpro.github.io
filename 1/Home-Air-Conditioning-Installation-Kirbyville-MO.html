<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to represent an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside your home is associated with a greater occurrence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems include a number of special features that can further improve performance and efficiency. For example, property owners may want to search for one that features a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy expenses much more. Naturally, more functions suggest higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
