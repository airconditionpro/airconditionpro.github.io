<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have several control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
