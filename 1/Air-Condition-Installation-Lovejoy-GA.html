<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Lovejoy Georgia</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check.

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
