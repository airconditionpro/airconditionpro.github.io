<p>Before setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a home, it is needed to re assess and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy effective home will not just lower the cost of a new system and utility bills, however it will considerably enhance the convenience of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements normally include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise several competent home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
