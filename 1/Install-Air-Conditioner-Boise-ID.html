<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
