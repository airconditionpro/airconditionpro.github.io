<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
