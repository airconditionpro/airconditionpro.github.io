<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
