<p>A specific air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
