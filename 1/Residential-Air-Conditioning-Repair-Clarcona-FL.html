<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of illness brought on by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
