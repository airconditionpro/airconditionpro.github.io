<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
