<p>Seattle heaters can run nine months of the year. Based on the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heating system will strive for you, but like your vehicle, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your service warranty intact.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to describe short cycling in extremely winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures.

If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
