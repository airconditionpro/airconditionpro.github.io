<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not toxic, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
