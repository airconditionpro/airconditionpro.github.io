I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually identified the trouble location in examining the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
