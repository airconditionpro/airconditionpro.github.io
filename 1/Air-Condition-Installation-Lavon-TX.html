<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Assessment of your furnace includes an Efficiency Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for precision and the burners are changed for optimal effectiveness. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the worthless 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by measuring the exhaust gasses and making scientific modifications. This alone could pay for the whole maintenance visit at today's rate of gas.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
