<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
