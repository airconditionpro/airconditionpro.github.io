<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Dexter MI</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
