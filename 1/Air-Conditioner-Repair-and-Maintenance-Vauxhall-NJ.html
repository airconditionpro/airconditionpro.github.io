<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

<p>Furnaces as they age risk of developing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, could leakage into your house unnoticed. Signs of this might be frequent headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like signs. Ought to you experience any of these, air out your house, open a window to the furnace space and immediately call a service technician. Cracks in the heat exchanger can happen unnoticed which is why no one recommends waiting up until they occur.

<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also assist manage germs and organic odors. The majority of store-bought filters can not remove these tiniest of irritants and do not remove bacteria and gases.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do feature some downsides. The biggest drawback is also the outcome of the combustion process. This procedure emits exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide, which have to be vented to the beyond the house. Carbon monoxide gas is an odorless gas, and is highly hazardous in greater concentrations. Because of this, a malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting issue could put your home's occupants in real danger. It is exceptionally crucial to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to make certain your home has a carbon monoxide gas alarm set up.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
