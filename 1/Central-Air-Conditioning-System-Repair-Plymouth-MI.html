<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
