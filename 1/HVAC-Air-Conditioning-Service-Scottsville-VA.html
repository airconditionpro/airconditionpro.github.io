<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Scottsville VA</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were really professional, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>These men have been great. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home may cost. Recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and choose to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can assist cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
