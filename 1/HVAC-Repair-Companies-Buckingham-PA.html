<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.
