<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
