<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
