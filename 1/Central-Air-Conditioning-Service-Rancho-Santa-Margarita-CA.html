<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
