<h3>Air Condition Company in Minnetonka Beach Minnesota</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
