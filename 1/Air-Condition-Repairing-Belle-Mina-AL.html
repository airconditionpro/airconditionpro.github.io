<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Belle Mina AL</h3>

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
