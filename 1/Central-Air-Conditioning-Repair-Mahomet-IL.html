<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
