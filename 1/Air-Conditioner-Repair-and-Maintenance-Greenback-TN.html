<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
