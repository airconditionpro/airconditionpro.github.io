<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Elwood IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe brief biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm climate for your home when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you require clarity on this issue, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
