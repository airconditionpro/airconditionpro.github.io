<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem greater than typical, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Drayton Plains MI</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
