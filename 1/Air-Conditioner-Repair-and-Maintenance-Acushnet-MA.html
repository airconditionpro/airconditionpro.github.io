<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
