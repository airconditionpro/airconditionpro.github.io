<h3>Electric Heating System in Malden Illinois</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC business owners don't understand they require different pricing schemes for different services that their company offers. For instance, residential HVAC installation need to be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service must be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you must separate these into different departments, as if they were their own separate service.<p>
<p>Considering that cooling and heating work might also require repairing or installing plumbing to supply oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may likewise be required to hold a different plumbing's license or have a certified plumber on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this type of work. When getting a price quote, make certain to ask not only if a company is licensed, however likewise what type of license it holds.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
