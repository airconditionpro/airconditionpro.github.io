<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
