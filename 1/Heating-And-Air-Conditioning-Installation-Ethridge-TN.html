<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture.
