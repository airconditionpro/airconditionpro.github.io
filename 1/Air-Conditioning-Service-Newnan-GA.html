<p>UW trainees, workers and visitors should have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's convenience, productivity, and health.

<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the scenario right away.<p>

In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex concerns-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack.
