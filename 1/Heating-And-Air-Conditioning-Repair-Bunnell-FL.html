<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
