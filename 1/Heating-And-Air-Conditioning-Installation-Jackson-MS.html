<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources.
