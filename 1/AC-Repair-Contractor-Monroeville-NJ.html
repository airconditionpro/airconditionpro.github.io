Some buildings can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into a space per an unit of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, air-conditioning and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy.
