<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
