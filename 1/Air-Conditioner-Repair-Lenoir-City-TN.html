<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Lenoir City TN Home</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as various as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, homes, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air circulation (ventilation), appropriate filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating securely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
