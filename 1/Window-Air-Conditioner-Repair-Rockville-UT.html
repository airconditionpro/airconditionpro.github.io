<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The answer to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will differ rather depending on industry of work, specialty, and position. What does not differ is the value of the work that these service technicians do. Heating and air conditioning systems control the temperature, humidity, and overall air quality in houses, office complex, schools, medical facilities, factories, shops, and other facilities.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
