Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity.

<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned.
