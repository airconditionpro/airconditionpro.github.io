These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
