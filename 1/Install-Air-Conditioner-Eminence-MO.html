<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Eminence MO Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
