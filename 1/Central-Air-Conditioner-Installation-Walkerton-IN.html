<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators used combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
