To make sure the unit you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the precise type of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply change it with the very same size system you presently have.

This action is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
