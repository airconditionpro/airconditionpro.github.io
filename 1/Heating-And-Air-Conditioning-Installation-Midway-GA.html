<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
