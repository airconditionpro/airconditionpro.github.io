<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
