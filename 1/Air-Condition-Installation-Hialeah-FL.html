<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
