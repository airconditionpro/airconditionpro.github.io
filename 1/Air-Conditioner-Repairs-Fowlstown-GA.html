<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
