<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
