<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Cooleemee NC</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
