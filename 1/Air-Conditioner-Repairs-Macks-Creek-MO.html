Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.
