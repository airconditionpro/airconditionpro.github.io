<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Initially, know that a majority of your central air and unit cost will come from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually surpass $10,000 for larger houses.

The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products present a threat only when they are handled in a way that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in.
