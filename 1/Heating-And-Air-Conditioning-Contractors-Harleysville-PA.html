<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
