<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be efficiently determined or corrected without a thorough structure examination. These investigations might begin with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building investigators assess the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. Sometimes, these questions might quickly reveal the problem and on-site gos to are unneeded.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
