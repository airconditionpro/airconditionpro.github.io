Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
