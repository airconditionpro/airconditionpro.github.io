<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A split a/c includes two main parts - a compressor located outside and a within air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided air conditioning unit depend on a set of pipes to connect the outdoor to the within air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split ac system installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
