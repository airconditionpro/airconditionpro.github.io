<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to contaminants during cooking. Improper modification, frequently suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas range or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly.
