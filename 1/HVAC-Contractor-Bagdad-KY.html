<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
