<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside.
