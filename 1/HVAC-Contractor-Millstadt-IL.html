The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
