<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
