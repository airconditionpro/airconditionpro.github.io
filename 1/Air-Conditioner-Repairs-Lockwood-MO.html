<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Lockwood MO</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit?
