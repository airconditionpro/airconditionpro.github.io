<p>The first thing that you will really need to install will be the air handler, which will can be found in your central heating system installation set. This part is generally installed in the basement of your house, set off several feet from any concrete walls. When installing this component, make sure that the condenser drain is set up in such a method that it will be able to drain away safely.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
