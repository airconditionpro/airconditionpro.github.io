If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
