<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
