<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Think about potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's instructions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
