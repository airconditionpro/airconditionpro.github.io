Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
