<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
