<p>Whatever heater you install, it's important that it's sized properly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
