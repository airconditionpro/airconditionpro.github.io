<p>They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>If your furnace stops working, start by calling RJ Heating. We typically discover that a simple repair or change is all that's required to help it run correctly again.

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
