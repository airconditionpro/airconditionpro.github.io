<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
