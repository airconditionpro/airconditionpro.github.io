<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
