<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
