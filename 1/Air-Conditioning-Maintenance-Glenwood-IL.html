<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than room air conditioners. In addition, they are out of the method, peaceful, and hassle-free to operate.

In a typical air-conditioned house, cooling takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy each year, causing power plants to give off about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
