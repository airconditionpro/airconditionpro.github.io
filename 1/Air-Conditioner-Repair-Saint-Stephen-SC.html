<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
