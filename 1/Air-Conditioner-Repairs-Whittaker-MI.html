Climate Pro is reputable and really cared about us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week!
