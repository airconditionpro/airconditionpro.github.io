<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
