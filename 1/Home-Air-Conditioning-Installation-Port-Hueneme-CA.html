<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
