<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
