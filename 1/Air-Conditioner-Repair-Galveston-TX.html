The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside system.

Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
