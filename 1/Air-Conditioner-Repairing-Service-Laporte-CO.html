<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than numerous heatpump alternatives, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you buy.

This means it can heat up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
