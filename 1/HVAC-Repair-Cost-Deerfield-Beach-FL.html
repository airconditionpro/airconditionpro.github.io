<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem greater than normal, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the money you'll save on repair costs. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

A house heated up by a radiant system will warm up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heat system can offer you.<p>
