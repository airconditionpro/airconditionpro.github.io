This would be an instance where you should contact an expert to examine and repair the unit.<p>

<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
