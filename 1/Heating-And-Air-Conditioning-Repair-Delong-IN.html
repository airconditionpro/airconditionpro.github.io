Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client grievances have actually been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active.

<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
