<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services ought to still be available for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into impact.<p>

<p>Whatever heater you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your house won't be heated adequately and the system will have to continuously go to try to heat the entire house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts however the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
