<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

<p>Similar to a lot of house enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary extensively based on the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and 20 years.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
