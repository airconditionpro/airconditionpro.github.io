<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
