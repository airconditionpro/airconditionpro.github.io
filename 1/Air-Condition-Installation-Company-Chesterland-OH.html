<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
