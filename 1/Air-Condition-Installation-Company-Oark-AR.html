<h3>Ways to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Oark AR</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>In general, repair and remodeling activities in owner occupied housing units are exempt to specific regulations associated with the management of lead.
