<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
