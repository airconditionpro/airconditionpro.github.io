<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Clinton North Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Clinton NC Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
