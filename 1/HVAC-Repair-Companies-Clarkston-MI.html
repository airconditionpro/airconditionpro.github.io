<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
