<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summertimes. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to colder seasons begin. Always make certain that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to prevent soot and condensation which causes burners to quit working properly. If your furnace is in an extremely poor condition, maybe it is time to begin considering purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
