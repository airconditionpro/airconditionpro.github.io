<p>First, in regards to perks, heating the entire home or building from one unit makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating system from the living space is a bonus offer for some property owners.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
