In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
