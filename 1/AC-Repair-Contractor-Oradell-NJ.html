<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and appreciated my house by constantly using boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of examination and also advised I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he thoroughly inspected and cleaned up the exterior compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also removed the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and advised a service to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got a comprehensive email report of the inspection detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I extremely recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
