<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
