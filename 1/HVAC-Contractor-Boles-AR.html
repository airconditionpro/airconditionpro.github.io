<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Boles AR HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been revealed to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
