<p>Furnaces are like cars. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part replaced or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below no night.<p>
