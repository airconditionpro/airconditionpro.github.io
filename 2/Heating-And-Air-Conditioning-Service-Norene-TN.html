<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Norene TN</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the entire surface of a floor heats the lower half of the room, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower general temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." To put it simply, in-floor heater supply a various mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
