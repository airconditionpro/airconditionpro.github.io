<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Consider prospective results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's directions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed.

While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
