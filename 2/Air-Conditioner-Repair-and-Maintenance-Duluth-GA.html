<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores often include greater price tags. So, ensure to choose based on how often you will use your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.
