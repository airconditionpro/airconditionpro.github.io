<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard.

Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
