<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
