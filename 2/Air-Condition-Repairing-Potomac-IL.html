<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
