<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (homes generally utilize between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
