<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment, please schedule a visit for a medical examination at the University Worker Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
