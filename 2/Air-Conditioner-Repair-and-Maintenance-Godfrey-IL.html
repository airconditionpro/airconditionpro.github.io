<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
