<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Clayton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator.

The a/c unit's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. A split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioner to install if your home already has no air but a furnace conditioner.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
