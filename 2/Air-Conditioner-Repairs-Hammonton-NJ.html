<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
