This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room cooling provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
