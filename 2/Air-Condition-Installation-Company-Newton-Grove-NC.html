<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Newton Grove NC</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
