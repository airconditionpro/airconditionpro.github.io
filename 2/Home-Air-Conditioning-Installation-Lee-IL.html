After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
