<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems.
