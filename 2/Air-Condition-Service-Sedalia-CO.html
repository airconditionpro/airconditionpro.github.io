<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Sedalia CO</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
