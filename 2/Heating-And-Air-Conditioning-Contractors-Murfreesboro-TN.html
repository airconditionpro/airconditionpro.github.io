<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
