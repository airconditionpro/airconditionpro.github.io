<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
