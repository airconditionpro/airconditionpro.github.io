CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.
