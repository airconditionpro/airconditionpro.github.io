Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up.

<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Draper UT</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
