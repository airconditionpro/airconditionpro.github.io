<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
