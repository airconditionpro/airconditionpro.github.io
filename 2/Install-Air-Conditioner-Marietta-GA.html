Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
