<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen hold on to your hair and clothes where it can quickly irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination. Do not have time for a fast rinse? At least clean your hands to remove remaining pollen, especially before reaching food or your face, suggests the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Try these tricks to pollen-proof your life, especially during allergic reaction season.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
