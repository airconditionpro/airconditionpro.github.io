<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Milford NH</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
