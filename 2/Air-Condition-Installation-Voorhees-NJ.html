<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stale air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating & cooling system uses considerably less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable effect on the environment.<p>
