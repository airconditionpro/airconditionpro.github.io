<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool needs to determine the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of specific health symptoms or diseases; determine all machines operated in the office; show the kind of outside air contamination; and determine prospective sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competitors for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
