<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
