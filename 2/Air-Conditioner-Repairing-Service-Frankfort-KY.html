<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
