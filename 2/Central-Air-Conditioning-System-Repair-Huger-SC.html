PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
