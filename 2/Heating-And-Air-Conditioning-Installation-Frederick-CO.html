<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Frederick CO</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>There are several variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such factors consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide emitted by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
