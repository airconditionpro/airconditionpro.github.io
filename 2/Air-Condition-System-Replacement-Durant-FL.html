<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are handled in a way that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a danger just. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>
