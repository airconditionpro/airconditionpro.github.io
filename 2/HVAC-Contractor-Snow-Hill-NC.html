<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Snow Hill NC</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
