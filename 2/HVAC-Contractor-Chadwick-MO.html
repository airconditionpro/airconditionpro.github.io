<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Chadwick MO</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
