An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
