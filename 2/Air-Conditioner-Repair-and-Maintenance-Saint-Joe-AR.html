<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service in Saint Joe AR</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
