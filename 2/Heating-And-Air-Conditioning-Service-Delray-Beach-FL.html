<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become an essential concern to house owners and health experts. Indoor air contamination studies have identified a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unpredictable natural compounds (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other benefits. Some companies provide top priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
