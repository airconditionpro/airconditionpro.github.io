<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

For this factor, it is necessary to take notice of the time and place symptoms occur.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
