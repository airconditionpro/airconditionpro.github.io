<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered exceptional, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, appealing and reliable. He clearly and thoroughly explained all problems and repairs in a way that made me positive in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in recent memory. He also responded to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to an issue that couldn't be solved on the very first check out due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
