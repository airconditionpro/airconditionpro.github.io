<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
