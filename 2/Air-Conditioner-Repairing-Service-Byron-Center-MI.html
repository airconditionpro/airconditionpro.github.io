<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
