<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
