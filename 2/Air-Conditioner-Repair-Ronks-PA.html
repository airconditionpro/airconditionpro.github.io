<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
