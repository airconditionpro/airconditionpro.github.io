<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
