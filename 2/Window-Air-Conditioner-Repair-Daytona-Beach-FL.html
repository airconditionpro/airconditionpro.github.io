One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of insufficient combustion.
