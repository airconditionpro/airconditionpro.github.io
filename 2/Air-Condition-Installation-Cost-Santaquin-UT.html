<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same.

Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
