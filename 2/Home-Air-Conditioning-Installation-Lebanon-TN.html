<p>Gas furnace repair professionals know that most mechanical failure in heating systems is due to malfunctioning initial installation or a repair that wasnâ $ t made properly.

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins however the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
