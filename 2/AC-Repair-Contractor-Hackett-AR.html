<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher frequency of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
