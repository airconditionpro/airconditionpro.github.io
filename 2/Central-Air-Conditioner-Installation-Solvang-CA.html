<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home.

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
