<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
