<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
