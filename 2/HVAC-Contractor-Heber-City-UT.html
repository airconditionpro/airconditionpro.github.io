<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of structures.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
