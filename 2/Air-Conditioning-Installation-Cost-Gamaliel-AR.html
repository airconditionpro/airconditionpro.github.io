<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually conducted. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Together with these weather changes, we've also been the country's fastest growing city over the last years, including well over 100,000 individuals, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In most locations of our country, air conditioning is a standard need, suggesting the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have cooling. Likewise, housing prices in Seattle have increased, and as an outcome, newer homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are likewise being converted to finished bed rooms to add extra area. Rooms in the upper areas of homes are specifically vulnerable to getting exceptionally hot and uneasy throughout the summertime, making air conditioning even more needed.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues.
