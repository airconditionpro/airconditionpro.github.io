So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
