<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air tracking tests performed.
