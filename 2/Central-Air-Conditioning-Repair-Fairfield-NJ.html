<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Fairfield NJ</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
