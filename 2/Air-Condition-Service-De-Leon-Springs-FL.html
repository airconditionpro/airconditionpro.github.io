<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
