<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly appear higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
