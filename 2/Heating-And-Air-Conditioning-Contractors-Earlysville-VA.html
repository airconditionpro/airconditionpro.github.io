A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
