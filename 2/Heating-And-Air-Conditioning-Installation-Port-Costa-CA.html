<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
