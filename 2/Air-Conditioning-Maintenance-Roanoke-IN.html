<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and maintain.<p>
