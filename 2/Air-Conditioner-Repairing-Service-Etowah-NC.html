<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and workplaces matters, especially considering that we spend most of our lives inside. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, these days. While lots of people presume contamination is just an outdoor problem, your house (and workplace) can likewise be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe adequate about exposure to all the things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
