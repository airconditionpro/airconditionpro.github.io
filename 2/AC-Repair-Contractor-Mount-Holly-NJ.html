<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
