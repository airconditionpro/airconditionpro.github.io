<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
