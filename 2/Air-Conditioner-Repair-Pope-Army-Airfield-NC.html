So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, first make certain the air filter is clean and in excellent condition. Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any accumulation of dust, debris and dirt, an affordable fix that can help improve efficiency. Also, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction.
