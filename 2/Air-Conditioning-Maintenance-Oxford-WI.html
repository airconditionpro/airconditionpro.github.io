<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>

The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more.

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
