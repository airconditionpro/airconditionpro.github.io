<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
