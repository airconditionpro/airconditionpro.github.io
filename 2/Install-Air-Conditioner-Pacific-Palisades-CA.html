<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
