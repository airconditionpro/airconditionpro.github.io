<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Greenfield</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
