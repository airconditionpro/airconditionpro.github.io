<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in La Grange Park IL</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
