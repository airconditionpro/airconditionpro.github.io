<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives normally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new construction (homes generally utilize in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
