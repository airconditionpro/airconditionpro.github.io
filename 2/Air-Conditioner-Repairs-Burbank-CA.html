<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
