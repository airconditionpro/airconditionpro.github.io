The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
