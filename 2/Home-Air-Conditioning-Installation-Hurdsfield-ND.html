Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
