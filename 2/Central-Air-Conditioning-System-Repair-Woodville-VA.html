<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
