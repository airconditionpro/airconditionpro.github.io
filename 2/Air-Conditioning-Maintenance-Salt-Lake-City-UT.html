Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that ought to be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
