<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
