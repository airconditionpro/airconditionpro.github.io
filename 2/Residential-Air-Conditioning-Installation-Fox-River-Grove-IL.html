<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
