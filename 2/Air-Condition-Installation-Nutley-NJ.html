<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
