<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
