<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
