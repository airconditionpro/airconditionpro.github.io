<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space.
