<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
