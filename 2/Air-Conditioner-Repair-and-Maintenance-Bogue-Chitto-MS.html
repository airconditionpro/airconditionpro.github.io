If the air quality is bad it can affect a person's health, performance, and comfort.

<p>In addition to these weather changes, we've also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last years, adding well over 100,000 individuals, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In a lot of locations of our nation, air conditioning is a standard need, meaning individuals that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have air conditioning. Likewise, housing rates in Seattle have increased, and as an outcome, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are also being converted to finished bed rooms to include additional space. Spaces in the upper areas of homes are especially prone to getting exceptionally hot and uncomfortable during the summer season, making a/c much more necessary.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.

Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
