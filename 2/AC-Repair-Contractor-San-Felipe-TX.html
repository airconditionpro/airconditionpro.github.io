<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
