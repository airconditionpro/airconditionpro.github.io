<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
