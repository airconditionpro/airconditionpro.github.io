<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>Think about possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
