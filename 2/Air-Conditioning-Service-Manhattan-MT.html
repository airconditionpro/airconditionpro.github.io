<p>Heat from a hydronic heating unit can make a home comfy even at lower temperature levels. You can turn the thermostat lower and conserve even more cash on energy since of this. If you run your hydronic heating system on a high-efficiency boiler at low temperature, you can increase its life expectancy. This saves you a lot more money in the long run. Our service technicians can further encourage you on how to conserve as much energy as possible with a hydronic heating unit.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
