Indoor air contamination research studies have actually recognized a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are essential in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness benefit. Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
