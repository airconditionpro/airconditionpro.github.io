<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Cornelius NC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "general duty clause" applies. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer must offer a safe and healthy  workplace. Therefore, making certain the air is of great quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
