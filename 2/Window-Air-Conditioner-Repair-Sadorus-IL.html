One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>

When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money.
