<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
