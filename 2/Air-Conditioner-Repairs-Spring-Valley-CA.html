<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
