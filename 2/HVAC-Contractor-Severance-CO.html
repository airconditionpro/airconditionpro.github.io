<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
