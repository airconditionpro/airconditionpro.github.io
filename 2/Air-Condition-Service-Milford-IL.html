<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
