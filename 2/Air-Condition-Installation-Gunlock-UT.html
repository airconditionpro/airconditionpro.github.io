<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Gunlock UT</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in warmth at a lower overall temperature level-- sometimes up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating system." In other words, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
