<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
