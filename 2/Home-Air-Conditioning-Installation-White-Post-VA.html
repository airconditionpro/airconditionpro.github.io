You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house.

Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
