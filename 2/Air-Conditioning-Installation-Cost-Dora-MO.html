<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
