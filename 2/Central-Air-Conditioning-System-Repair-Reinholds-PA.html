<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
