<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.
