<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
