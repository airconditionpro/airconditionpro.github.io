<p>Most people know that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have substantial, damaging result. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of toxins might be two to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the top five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
