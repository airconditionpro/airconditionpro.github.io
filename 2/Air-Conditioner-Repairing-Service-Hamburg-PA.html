<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Hamburg PA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
