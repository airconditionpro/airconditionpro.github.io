<p>A primary factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an efficient, appropriately created and running ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is added to the office environment, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its pollutants are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outdoors throughout the structure.<p>
<p>Because these activities produce large quantities of lead dust, people have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for ideas on which public firms or personal labs may be able to help test your house for lead in paint. House test kits can not spot percentages of lead under some conditions. Employ a person with special training for fixing lead paint problems to eliminate lead-based paint. Residents, specifically children and pregnant females, ought to leave the building until all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>More frequently, however, detectives will need to come to the building to conduct individual interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources of the problems, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other structure functions. Because taking measurements of pollutants at the really low levels typically found in office buildings is pricey and might not yield details easily helpful in recognizing problem sources, private investigators may not take lots of measurements. The process of solving indoor air quality issues that lead to health and convenience grievances can be a slow one, including several trial options prior to successful therapeutic actions are identified.<p>
