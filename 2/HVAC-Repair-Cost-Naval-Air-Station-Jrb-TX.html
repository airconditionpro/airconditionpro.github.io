<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
