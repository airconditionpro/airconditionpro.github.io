<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>

In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong recommendation not to do so.

<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
