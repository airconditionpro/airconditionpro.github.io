<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
