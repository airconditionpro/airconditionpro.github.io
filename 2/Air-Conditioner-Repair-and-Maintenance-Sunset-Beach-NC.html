When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping machine to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other short articles in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
