<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same.

Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
