<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can mean considerable savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
