<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
