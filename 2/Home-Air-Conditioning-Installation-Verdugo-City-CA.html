<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment.
