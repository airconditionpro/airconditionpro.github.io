<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.
