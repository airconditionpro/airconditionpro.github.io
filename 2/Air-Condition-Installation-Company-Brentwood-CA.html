<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy expenses.

In reality, our Security Evaluation includes 10 separate safety checks of your system.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or techniques utilized. The EPA study recommended and controlled approaches used on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings.

So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
