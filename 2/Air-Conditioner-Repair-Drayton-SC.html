<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
