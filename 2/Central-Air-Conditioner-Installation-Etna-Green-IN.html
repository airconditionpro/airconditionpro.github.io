<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is trusted and really appreciated us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>
