So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
