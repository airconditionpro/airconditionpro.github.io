<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
