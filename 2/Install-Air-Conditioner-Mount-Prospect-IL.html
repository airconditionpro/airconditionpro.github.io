<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that should be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
