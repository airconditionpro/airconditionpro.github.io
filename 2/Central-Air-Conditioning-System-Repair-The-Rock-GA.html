<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, especially since we spend most of our lives indoors.

<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
