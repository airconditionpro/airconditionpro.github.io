<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants.
