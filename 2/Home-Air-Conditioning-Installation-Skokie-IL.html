<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Skokie IL Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
