<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also due to the fact that a drain needs to be set up.<p>
