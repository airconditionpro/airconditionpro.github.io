Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations develop inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
