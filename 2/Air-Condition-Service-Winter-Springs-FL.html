An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same.

Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
