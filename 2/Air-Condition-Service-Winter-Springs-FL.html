<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
