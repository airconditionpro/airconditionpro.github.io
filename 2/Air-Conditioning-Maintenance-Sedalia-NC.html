<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Sedalia NC Home Owners</h3>
<p>Health center running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection risk and the humidity managed to limit patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are typically in the comfort variety, some expert procedures, such as open heart surgery, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and process applications, the objective might be to not just control temperature level, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to area.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
