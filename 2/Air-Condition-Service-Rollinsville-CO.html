<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you live in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to.
