<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been properly dried.
