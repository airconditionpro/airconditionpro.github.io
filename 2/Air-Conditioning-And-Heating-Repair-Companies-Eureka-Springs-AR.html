<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. Most of the time they were at first thinking about remotely keeping an eye on some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and implemented indoor air quality keeping track of to supply a healthier, more secure building environment-- and to head off the negative consequences related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
