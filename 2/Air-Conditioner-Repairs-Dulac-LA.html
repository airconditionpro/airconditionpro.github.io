<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Dulac Louisiana</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
