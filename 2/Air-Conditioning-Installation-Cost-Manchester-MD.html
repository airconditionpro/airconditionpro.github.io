Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a business or seller to do the installation.
