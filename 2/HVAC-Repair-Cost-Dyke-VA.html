<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
