<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
