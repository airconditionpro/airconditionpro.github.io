<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
