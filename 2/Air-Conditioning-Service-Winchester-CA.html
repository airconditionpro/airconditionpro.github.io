<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, many Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c devices.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
