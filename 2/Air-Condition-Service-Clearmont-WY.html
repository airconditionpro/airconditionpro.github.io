<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
