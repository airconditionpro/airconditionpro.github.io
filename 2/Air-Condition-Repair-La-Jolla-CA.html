<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company.

Some companies use top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
