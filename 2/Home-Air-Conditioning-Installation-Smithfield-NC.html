<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%.
