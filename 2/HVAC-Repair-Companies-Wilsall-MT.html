<p>Air conditioning system makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they need to be positioned. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people mostly stay seated in that particular location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're attempting to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly.

Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
