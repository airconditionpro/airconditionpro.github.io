<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
