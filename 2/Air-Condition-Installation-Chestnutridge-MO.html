<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at the same time, however are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
