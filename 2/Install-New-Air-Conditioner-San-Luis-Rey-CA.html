<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
