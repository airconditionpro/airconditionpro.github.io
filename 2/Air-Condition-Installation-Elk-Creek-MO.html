<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
