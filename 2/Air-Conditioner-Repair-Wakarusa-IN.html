<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the service technicians believed they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
