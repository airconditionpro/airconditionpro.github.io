They might suggest that you trim back thick trees or bushes to guarantee sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand.

Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
