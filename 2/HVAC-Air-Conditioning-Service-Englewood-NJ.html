This is generally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour.

<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system.
