<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
