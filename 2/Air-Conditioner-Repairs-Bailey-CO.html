<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Bailey CO</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
