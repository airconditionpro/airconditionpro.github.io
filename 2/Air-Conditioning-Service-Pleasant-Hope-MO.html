<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to evaluate scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, terrible summer season.<p>
