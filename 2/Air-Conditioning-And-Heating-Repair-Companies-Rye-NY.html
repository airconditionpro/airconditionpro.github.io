<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
