<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
