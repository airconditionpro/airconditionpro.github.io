<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate.

Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
