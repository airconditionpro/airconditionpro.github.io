They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
