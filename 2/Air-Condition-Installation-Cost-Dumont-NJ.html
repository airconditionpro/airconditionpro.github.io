<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same.

<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
