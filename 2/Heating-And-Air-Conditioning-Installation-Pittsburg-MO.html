Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
