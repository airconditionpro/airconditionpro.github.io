<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.)
