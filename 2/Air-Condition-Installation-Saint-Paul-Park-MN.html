There can be a severe danger from the cumulative results of these sources.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
