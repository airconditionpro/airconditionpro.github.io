<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
