<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Bristol IN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency over time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
