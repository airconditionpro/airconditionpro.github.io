<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
