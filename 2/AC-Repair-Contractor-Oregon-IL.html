<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have actually handled the one repair I required well, and are expert and always on-time. Have been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
