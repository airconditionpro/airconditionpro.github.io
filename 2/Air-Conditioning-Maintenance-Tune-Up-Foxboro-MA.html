PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
