Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I required well, and are professional and always on-time. Have been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is absolutely the very best I've had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
