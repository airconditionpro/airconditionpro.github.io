<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, cruel summer.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
