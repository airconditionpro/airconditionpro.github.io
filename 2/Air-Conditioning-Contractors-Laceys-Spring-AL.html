<p>Heating systems as they age risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, might leak into your house undiscovered.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
