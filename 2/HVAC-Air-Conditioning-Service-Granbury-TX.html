<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
