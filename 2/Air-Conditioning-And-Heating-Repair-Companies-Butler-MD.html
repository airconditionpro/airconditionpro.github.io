During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
