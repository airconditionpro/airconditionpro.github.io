<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
