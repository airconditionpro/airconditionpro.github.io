<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
