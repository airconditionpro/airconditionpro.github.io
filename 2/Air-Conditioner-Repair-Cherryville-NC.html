<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short biking in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather condition is extremely cold.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>

Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
