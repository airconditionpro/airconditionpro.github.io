<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response data which show the health effects of repeated exposure to one particular chemical.

<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to likewise be inspected regularly. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire risk.
