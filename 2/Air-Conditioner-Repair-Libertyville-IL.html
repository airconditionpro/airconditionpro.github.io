These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Ac system manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
