<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
