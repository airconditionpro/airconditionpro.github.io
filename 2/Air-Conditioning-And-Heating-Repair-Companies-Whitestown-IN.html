<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Reliable on the whole.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
