<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
