<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an ac system, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house properly. These are just a few of the aspects that you require to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system.
