<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, restricting air flow. Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem extremely daunting in the beginning, needing specialized tools, devices, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
