<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Red Feather Lakes CO</h3>
<p>The majority of people know that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have considerable, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top five environmental health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
