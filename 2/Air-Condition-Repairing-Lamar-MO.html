The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption.

More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
