<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate issues-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods below might be proper.<p>
