PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
