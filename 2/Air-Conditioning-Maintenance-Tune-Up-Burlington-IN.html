<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
