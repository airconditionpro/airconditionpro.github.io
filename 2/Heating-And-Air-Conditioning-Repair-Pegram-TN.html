<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
