<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.
