<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
