<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and offices matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity.

A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
