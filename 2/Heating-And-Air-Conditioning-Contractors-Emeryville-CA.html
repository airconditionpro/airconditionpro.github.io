<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house.
