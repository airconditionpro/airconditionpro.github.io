Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to determining the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
