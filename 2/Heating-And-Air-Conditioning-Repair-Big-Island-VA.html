<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Big Island VA</h3>

You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes effectively. A constraint in your drainage pipes triggers a water leakage. There are several places a clog can take place. One of the primary locations where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
