<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
