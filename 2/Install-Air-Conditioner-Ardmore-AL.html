However, in the United States, as in other countries, regulative progress largely stops at the doorway. This is not to say that there aren't standards for levels of CO and NO2; numerous bodies have actually set requirements and standards for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Security and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have actually set CO standards, but the EPA's standards only apply to outdoor air.

<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space.

Stagnant air might also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the variety of employees in the area.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these pollutants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room furnishings that accumulate dust, specifically if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Since vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite allergens and other biological impurities, allergic people need to also leave the home while it is being vacuumed. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high performance filters might also be of assistance.<p>
