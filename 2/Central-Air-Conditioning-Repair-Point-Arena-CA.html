<p>Professional heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>

By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
