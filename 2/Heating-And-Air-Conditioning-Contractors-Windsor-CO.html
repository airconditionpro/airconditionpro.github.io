<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
