<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Warsaw MO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an excellent job in making certain we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were professional and fast, while requiring time to make certain we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
