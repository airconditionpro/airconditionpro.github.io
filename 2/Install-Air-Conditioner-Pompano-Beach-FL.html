<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
