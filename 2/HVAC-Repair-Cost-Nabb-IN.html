<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
