<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
