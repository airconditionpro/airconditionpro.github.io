<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
