He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones got.

ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
