And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month could be utilized to help you spend for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating expenses with heating expenses from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a considerable difference.<p>
