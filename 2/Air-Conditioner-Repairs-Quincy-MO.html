According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the house might include mold, germs, viruses, termites, and pollen.
