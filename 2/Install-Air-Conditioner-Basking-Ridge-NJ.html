<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Basking Ridge NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
