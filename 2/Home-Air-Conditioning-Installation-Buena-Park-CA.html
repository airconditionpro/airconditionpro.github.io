<h3>Heating And Cooling Contractors in Buena Park CA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
