<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
