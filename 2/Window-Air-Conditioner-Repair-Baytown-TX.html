Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
