However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
