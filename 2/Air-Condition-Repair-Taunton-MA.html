<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
