<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
