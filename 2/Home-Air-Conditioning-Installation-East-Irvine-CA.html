<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in East Irvine CA</h3>
<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
