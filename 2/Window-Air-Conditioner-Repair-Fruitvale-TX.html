Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
