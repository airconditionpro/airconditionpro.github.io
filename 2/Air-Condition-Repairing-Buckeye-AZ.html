<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to evaluate building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These treatments range from sophisticated tracer gas methods used mainly in constructing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators. NIST scientists are continually developing new test procedures, and after that showing them in the field to examine their expediency and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has resulted in the development of a crucial database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
