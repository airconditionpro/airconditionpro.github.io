<p>Indoor contaminants.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
