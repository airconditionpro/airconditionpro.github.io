<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Zebulon NC - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
