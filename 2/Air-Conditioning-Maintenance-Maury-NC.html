<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have actually efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER.

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to increase and stream out high structure openings to the outside (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use extremely little energy, but care should be required to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, preserving thermal convenience entirely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
