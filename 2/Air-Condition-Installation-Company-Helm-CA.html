<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
