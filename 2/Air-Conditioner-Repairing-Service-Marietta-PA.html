Many typical structure products utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically suggested instead.<p>
