<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
