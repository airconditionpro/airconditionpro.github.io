<h3>Heating Company in Onyx CA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
