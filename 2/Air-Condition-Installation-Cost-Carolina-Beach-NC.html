<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, especially guidelines on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
