<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
