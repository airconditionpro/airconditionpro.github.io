<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.
