<p>The task development in this field is credited to the expected boost in building construction coupled with the truth that climate control systems are becoming more typical. Likewise, because systems need to be replaced after about a years, many structures will become due for replacement units in the next couple of years. Due to these factors, the job development for this occupation is higher than average.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
