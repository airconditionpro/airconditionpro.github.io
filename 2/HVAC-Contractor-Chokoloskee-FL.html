<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the world, including EMV. He's stated a number of times that the unique code feature is optional and many, many retailers do not use it because it decreases transactions much more due to the back-and-forth communications needed. I do not know sufficient about the technology to know if that is even possible.<p>
<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running hundreds of yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite pricey. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
