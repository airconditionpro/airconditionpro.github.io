<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
