<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
