<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Lockwood MO</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
