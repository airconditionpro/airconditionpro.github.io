For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place signs take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the area, for example, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside your home.<p>
