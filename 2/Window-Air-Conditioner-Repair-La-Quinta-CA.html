<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in La Quinta CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your home, and if it establishes fractures which leakage, they need to be repaired.

Setting up new ductwork for the entire house will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
