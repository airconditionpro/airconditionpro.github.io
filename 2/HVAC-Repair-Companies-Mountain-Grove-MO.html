<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise innovation. Martin stated the company can establish a dashboard within the building's controls that will supply data on its systems to enable actual time presence, supplying the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not simply during new building and construction.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
