<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that consistently monitors energy intake and temperatures in shops to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
