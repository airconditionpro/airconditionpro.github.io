<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher occurrence of resident breathing issues.<p>
