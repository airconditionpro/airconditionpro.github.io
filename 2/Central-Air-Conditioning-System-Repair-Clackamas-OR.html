<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
