Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
