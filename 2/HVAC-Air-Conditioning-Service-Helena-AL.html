Simply put, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely effective, vanquishing most other types of heater in effectiveness. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which usually indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants remove substantial amounts of pollutants in offices and homes. Since extremely moist soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
