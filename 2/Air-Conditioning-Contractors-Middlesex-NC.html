What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives.
