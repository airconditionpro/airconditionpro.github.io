<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
