<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be installed in all restrooms and kitchens. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are quiet and resilient. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an adequate period of time. A great rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>

Ventilation, a common technique of lowering direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will minimize but not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they build up because smoking produces such large quantities of toxins. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to substantially reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs substantially. Consequently, the most reliable method to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
