<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
