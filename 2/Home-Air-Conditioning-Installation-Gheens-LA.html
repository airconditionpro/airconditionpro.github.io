<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Gheens LA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Gheens LA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
