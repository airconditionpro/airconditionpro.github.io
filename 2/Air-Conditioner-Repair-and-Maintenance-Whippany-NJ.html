<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration.
