<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in San Fernando CA</h3>

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
