<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
