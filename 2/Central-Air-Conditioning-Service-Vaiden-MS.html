<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
