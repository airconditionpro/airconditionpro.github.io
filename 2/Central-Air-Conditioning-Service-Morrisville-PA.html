<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment might require unique licenses, and there is restricted flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician examine the system regularly.<p>

In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
