<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

This can lead to the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
