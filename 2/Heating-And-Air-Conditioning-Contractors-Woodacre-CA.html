<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
