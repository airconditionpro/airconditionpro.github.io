<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system.
