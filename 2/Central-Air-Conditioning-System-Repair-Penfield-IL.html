<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
