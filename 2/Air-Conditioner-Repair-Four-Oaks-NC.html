When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

During the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.
