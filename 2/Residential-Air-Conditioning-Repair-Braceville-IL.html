<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
