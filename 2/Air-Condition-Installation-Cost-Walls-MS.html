<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided excellent customer care at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
