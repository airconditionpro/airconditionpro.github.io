<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.
