The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
