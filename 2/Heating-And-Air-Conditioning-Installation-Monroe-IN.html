<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
