It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a construct or renovation project.

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
