<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
