<p>Expert heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
