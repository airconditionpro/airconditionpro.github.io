<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Spring Hill</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.
