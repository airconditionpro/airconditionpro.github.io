<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Dunkerton IA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
