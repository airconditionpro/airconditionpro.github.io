<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Somerset MA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler normally happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
