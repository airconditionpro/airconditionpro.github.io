They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
