<p>There are numerous actions a house owner can require to select products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing strong wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.
