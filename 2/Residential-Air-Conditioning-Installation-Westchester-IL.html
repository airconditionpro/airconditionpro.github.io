<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
