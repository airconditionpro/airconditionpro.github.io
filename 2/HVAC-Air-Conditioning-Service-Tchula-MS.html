<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, particularly considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very humid climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity.

<p>Similar to many house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years.
