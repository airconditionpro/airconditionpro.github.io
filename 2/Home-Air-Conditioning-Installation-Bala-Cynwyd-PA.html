<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
