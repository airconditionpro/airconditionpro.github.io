<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Carter Lake IA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>

Termite damage can be lowered or prevented by making sure that wooden structure materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood away from the house. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be dramatically minimized.<p>
