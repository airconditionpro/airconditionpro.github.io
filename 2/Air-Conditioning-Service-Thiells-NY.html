<p>Some health impacts might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable.

Right after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some illness such as asthma may show up, be worsened or worsened.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a cars and truck radiator or normal home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
