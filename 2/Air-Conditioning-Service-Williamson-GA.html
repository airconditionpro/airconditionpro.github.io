<p>Property owners might likewise assume that due to the fact that a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will right away raise their home's value.

That said, property buyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
