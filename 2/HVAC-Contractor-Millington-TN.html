Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing.

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
