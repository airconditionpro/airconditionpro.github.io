<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
