An air conditioning system also decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -patients.<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size central air system for your home is very crucial, as is selecting either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one unit, or a split system, which positions the condenser outside the house and the fan and coil within.

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
