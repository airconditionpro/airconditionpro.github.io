<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Prosper TX</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
