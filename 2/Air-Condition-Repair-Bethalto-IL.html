<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed representative from an organisation or seller to do the installation.
