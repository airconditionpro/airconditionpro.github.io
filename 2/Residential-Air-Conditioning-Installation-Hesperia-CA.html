<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it may work as a pathway to carry the contaminants inside.
