Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is normally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
