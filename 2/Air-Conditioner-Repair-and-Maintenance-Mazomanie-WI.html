<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
