However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
