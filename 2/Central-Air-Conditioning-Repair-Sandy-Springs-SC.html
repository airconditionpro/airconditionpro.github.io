<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually performances ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE OFFICER.

This means for every single system of energy utilized to power the system, three to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>
