Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
