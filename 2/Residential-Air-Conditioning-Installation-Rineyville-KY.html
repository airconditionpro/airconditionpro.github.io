<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.
