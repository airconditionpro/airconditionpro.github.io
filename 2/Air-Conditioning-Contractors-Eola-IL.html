<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an acceptable variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a number of special functions that can even more improve efficiency and performance.
