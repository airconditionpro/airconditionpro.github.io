<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
