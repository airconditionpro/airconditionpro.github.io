<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the right temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned.

This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
