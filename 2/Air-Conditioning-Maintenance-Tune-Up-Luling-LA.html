<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
