<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Louisville TN - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
