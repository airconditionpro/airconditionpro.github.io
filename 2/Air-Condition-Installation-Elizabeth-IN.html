<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
