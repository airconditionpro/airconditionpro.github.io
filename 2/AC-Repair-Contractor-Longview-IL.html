<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
