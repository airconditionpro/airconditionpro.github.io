<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Longview IL</h3>
<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is filthy or clogged Prior to trying to fix any problem, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

Call a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
