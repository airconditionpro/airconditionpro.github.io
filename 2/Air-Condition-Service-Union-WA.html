<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. There are a number of design approaches in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
