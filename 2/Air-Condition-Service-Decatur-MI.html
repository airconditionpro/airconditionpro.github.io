<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system may become extremely filthy.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is integrated.
