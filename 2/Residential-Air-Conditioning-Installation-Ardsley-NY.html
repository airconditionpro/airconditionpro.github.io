<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
