<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
