<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
