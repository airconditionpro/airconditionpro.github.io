This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
