<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
