<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
