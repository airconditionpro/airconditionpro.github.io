<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, especially if you make it part of a build or restoration project.
