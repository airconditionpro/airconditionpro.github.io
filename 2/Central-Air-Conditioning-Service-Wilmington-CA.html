He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they must be put. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mainly stay seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly.
