<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
