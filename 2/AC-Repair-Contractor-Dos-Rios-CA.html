<p>Air pollutants can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off.

Since excessively damp soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic people, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
