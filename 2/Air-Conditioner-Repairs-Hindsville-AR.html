Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
