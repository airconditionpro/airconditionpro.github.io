My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem.
