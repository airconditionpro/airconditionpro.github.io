<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
