Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.
