<h3>Ways To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Lebanon PA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
