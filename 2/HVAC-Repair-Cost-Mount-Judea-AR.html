<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
