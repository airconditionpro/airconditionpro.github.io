<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
