<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
