Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
