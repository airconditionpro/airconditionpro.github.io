<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Harvey AR</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
