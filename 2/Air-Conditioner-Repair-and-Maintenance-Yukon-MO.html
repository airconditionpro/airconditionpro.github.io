The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Yukon MO</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
