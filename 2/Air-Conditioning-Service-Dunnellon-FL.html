<p>Because a project such as this is going to require a somewhat extensive quantity of work it is advised that a property owner demand numerous estimates from a variety of contractors.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
