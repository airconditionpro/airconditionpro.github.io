<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
