The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
