<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
