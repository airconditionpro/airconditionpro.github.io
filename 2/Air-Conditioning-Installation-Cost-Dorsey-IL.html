<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
