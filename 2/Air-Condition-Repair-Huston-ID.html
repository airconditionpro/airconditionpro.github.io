Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) refers to less regular (however typically more major) cases of people becoming ill after remaining in a specific building at a particular time.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
