<p>Brian was every bit sincere, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, helpful and helpful - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work site was left absolutely cleared and cleaned. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
