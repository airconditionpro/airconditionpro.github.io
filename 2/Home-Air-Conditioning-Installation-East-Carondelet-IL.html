<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
