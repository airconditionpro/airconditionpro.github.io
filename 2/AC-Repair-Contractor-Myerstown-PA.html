<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Myerstown Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
