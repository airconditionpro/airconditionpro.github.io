"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
