<p>As kept in mind, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may also contribute to worker health complaints. Temperature level levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation must be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and proper air blood circulation will help to decrease the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
