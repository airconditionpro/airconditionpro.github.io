<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
