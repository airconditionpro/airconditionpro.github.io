Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
