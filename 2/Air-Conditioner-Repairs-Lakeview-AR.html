<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
