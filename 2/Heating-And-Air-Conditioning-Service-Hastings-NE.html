It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>I highly recommend using this service. Extremely reputable incredibly nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under warranty fast and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

I am presently on the maintance plan. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be reminded to do it.<p>
