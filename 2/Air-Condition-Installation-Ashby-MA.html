<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
