<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized.

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice.
