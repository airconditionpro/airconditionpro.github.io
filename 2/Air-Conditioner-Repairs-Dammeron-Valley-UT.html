<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
