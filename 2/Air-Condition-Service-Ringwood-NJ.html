Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit will not be able to cool your home correctly. These are just a few of the factors that you need to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
