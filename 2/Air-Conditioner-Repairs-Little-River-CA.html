<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
