<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
