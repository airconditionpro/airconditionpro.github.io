<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but numerous use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
