PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
