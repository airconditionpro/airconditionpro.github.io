<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
