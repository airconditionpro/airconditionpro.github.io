<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below might be proper.<p>
