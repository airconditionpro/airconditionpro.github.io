<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, cruel summer season.<p>
