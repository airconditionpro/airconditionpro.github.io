<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
