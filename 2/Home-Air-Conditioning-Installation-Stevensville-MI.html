<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
