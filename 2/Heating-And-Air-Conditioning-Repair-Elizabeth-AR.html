<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
