<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
