<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for remarkable service.

We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
