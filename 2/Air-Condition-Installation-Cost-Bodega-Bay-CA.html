This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be replaced ultimately. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient.

If your system is near, or past, its expected lifespan, replacement may be the most economical solution.<p>
