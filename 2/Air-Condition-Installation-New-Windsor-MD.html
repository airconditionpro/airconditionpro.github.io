<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in New Windsor MD</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system may cost near to that of a traditional HVAC system but has proven to be an alternative cost effective alternative to homes that do not have ductwork. Used together with other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c, space heating systems, or oil heaters, it can enhance the convenience of your home while keeping your regular monthly utility costs affordable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
