<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside.<p>
