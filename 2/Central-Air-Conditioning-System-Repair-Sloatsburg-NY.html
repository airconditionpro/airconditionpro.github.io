<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Sloatsburg NY</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
