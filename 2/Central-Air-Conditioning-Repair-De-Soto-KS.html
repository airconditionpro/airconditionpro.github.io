If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
