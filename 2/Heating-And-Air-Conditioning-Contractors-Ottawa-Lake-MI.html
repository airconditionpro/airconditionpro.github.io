<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, simple and a completely enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and expertise to FIX the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's five years old or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the very same quantity of cooling.<p>
