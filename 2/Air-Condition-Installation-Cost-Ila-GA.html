<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
