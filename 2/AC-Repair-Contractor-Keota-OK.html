<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can remain and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up till several years after exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought home from job sites.<p>
