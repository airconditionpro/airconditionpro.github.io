<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the suggested connections in addition to temperature level and pressure determines. Require time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
