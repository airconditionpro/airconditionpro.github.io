<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
