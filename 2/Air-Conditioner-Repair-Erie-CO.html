<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.
