<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
