<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
