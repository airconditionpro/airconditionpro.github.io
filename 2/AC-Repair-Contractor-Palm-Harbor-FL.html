<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
