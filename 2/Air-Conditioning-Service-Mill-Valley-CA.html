<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
