We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies use top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
