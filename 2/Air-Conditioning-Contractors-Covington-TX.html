<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or typical home air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation.

Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
