<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a vehicle radiator or common household a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time.
