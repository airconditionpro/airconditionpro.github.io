<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can likewise result in duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT a good idea. You will not conserve any money and will wind up triggering more issues for your heating system.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
