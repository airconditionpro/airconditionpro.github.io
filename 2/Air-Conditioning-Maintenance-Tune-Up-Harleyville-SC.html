<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
