<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
