<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
