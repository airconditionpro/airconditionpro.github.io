<p>There are lots of reasons this can take place. Fortunately is that you can address a number of these factors on your own without the requirement to require professional assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
