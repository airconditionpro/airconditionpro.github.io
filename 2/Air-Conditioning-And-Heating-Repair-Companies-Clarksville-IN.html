<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
