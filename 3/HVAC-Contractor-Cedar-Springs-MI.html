<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Cedar Springs MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<h3>Heating Systems in Cedar Springs MI</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
