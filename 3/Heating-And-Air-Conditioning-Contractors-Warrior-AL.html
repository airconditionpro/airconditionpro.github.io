<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage.

Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
