<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
