We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
