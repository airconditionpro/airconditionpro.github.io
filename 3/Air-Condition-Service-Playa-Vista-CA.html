<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
