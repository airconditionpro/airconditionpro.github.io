<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
