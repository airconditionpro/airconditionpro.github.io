<p>We included a new 1500 sf office space to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Integrity we were offered a great quote on a radiant floor system.

It was an enjoyment working with such a professional company and would extremely advise them to anyone trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
