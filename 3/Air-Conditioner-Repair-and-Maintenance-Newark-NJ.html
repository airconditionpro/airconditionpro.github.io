<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping machine to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other articles in the spaces, including the human residents.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
