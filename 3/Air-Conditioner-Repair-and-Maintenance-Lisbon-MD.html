<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Lisbon MD</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
