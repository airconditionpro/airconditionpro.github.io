<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. There are several design approaches in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Power resources: Confirm your access to electrical resources. Many older houses have limited ability to include major appliances at the level of a central air conditioning conditioner.

Your AC installer will understand what to look for.<p>
