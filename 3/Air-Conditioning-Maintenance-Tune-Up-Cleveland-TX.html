<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning items, building activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
