<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, consider possible results of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
