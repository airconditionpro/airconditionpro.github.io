<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
