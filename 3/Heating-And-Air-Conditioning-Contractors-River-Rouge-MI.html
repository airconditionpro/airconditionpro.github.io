<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transfer the heat to the spaces. Many modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
