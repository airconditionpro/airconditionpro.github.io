<p>We take a look at hints before we offer suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>

So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
