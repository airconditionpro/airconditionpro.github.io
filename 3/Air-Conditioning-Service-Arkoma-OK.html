<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature throughout the year.
