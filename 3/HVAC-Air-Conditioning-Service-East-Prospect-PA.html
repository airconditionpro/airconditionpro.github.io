<p>Consumer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
