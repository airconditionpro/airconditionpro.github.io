Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
