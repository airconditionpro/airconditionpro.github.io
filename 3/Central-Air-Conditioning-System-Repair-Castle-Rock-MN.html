<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
