The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
