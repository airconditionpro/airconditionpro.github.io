<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.
