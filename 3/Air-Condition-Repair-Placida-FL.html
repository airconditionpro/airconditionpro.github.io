<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
