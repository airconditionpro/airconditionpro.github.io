We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
