<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
