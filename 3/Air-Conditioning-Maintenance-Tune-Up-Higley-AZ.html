<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Higley AZ</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has performed. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be true.

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification.
