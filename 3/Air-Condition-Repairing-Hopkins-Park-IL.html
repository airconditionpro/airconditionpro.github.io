<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to likewise be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators.

Radiant heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>

If the existing system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
