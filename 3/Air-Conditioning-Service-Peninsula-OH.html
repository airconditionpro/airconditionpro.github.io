<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
