<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
