<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Cottleville MO Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
