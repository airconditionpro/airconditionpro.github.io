Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of.
