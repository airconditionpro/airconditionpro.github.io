Left untreated, these problems can lead to loss of efficiency and worse, breakdown of part materials and a much shorter furnace lifespan Gradually, crucial elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start wearing away, causing decreased performance.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify an especially energy-efficient in-floor heater and pick to install it in your home, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax deductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>
