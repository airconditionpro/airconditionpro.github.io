<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Parma ID Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
