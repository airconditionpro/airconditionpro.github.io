<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Hinsdale IL</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
