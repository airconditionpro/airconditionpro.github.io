<h3>HVAC Repair in Poquoson Virginia</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Many people don't understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the performance of the system and ultimately damage it enough that you need to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will thoroughly analyze the connections and assess the efficiency of the system. They'll try to find torn and harmed wires and replace them in order to reduce the threat of fire and component failure.<p>
<p>The basic duties of an HVAC technician consist of setting up, preserving, and repairing heating, refrigeration, and air systems. HVAC service technicians can be required to do a number of minor tasks within these basic locations of work. Likewise, some HVAC companies focus their services on exclusively repair or installation. They might also focus on micro-niches of HVAC such as photovoltaic panels, water-based heating, and commercial refrigeration.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
