<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
