<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
