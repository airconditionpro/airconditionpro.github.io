<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Penns Park PA</h3>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
