<p>The primary reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
