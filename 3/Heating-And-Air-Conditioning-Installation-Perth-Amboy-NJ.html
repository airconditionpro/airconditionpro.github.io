<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>For example, Carrier has introduced its Unfavorable Air Maker for healthcare facilities that it states cleans polluted air and avoids it from infecting various areas of a healthcare facility. Senseware, a smart structure startup known for air quality monitoring, launched a solution bundle in partnership with other vendors to assist customers safely reopen their companies.
