<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.

<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Warrenville Illinois</h3>
<p>As a skilled HVAC professional, we recommend you have your systems inspected and routine maintenance performed two times each year, when in the Spring (before cooling season) and when in the Fall (prior to heating season).

Keeping what is probably the most expensive and important system in your home (heating & cooling) properly kept will help keep your greatest financial investment of your life in good shape.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to maintaining an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can produce a lot of water since they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil.
