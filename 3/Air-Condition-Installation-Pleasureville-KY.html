<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
