<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
