<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
