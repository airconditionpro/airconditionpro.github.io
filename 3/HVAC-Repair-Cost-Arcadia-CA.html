<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
