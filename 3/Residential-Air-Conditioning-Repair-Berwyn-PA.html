This is typically used in a third-floor or 2nd location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put.

Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
