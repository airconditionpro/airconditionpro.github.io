On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem. Furthermore, since they do not trust fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
