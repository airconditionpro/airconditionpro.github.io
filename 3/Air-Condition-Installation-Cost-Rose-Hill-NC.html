<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
