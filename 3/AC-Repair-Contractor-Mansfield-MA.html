<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to leave your home so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a dangerous accumulation and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are blocked. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will try to find signs of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn supplied great customer support at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
