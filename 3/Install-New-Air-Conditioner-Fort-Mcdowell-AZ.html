<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
