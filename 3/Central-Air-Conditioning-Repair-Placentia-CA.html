<p>Due to the fact that an ac system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one.
