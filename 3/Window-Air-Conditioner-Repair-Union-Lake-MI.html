<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
