<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
