<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical energy, a heatpump is a cost-effective service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can typically be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
