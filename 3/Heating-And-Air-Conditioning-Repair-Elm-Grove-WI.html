One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist present, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.
