<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered.
