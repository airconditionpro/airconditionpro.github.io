<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
