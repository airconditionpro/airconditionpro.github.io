<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
