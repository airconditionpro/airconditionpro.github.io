<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Mays Landing NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
