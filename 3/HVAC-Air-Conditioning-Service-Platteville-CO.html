<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
