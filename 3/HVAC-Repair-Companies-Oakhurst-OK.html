<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced regularly, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.
