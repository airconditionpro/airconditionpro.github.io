<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
