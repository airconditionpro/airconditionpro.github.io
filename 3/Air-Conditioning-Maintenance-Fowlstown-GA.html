<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
