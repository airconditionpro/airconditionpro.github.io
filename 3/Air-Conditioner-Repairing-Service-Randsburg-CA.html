<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
