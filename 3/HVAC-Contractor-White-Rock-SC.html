<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
