<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
