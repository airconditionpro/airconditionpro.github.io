<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological contaminant. Biological contaminants in the home may include mold, germs, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger contagious illness such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Symptoms caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, dizziness, and respiratory infections.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
