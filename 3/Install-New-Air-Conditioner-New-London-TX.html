<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
