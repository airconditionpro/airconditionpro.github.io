<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the rooms dust-free is simpler without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
