<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
