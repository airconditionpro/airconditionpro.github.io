<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
