<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.
