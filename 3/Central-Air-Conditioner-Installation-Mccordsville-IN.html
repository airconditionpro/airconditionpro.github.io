<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
