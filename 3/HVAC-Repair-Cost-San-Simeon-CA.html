<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
