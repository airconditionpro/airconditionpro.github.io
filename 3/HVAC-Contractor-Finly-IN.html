<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Finly IN</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
