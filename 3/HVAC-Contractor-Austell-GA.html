<p>Similar to the majority of home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
