<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, since it takes into account not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
