<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
