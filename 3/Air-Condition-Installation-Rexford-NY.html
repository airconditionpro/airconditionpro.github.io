<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and unclean. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's performance. To make certain the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
