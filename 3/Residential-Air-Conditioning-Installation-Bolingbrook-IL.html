<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
