Load calculating is described as the Manual J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunlight to work efficiently.

This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
