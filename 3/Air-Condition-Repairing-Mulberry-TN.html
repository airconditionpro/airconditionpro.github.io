Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the essential electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
