<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
