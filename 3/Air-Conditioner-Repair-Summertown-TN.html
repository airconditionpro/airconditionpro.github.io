<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
