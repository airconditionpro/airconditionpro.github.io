<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
