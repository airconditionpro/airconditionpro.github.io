<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Pacific Grove CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss detail that develops a task effectively done. I extremely extremely recommend the 2 gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an exceptional task in ensuring we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each choice.
