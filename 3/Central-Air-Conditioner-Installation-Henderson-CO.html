<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

Need heats up throughout the summertime and winter season when clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here.<p>
