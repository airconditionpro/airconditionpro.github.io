The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
