Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.

When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
