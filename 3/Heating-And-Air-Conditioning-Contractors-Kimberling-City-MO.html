<p>Particular immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to determine if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to take note of the time and place the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, humidity, or cooling conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Some health impacts can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after an individual transfers to a new house, remodels or refurnishes a home, or deals with a home with pesticides. If you think that you have symptoms that might be related to your home environment, discuss them with your physician or your local health department to see if they could be brought on by indoor air pollution. You might also wish to consult an occupational medication or a board-certified specialist expert for answers to your questions.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
