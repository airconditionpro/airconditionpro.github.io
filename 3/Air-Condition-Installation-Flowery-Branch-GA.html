<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
