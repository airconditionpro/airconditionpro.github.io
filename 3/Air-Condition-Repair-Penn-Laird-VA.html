<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Penn Laird VA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We included a new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Stability we were offered an excellent quote on a glowing flooring system.

The systems works wonderful and the brand-new workplace feels really comfortable. It was an enjoyment working with such a professional company and would highly advise them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
