<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest.

A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
