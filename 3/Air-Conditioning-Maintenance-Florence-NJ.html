<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
