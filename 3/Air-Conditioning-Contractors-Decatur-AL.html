<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Decatur AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
