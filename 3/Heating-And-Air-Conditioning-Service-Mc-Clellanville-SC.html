<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it considers not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same duration. Basically, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
