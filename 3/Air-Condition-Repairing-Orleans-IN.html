<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Orleans IN</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are moist or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and family plants.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
