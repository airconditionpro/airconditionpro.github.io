<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
