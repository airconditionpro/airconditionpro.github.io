<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
