They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
