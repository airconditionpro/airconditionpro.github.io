<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
