<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes usually use in between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

He is honest, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
