<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
