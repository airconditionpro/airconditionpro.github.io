<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, numerous Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
