<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
