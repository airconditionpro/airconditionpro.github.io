A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses.

The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be higher, as much as 3 times higher than gas or electric furnaces. They need a storage tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they offer an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
