<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Duncans Mills CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
