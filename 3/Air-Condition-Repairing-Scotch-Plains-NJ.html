These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A split ac system includes two primary parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet system. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioning unit rely on a set of pipelines to connect the outside to the inside air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split a/c installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>
