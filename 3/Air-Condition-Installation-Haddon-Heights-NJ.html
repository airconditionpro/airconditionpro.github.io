<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
