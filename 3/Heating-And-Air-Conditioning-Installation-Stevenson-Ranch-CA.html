<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
