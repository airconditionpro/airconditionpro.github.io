<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common features of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green structure motion.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post anticipated that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
