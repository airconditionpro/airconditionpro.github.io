<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.
