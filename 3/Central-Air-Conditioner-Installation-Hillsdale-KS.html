Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid also. Many manufacturers state on guarantee documents that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC provider are a part of the warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts minimal guarantee as is standard on Carrier Â® furnaces, you'll want to make certain you keep that coverage valid for the full ten years.<p>
