<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated effectiveness advantage. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
