<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
