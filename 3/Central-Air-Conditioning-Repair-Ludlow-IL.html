<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
