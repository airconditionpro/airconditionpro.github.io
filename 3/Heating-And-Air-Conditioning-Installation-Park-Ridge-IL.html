<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Park Ridge IL</h3>

In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
