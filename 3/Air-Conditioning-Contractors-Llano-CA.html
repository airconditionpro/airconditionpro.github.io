<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
