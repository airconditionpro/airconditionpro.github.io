<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
