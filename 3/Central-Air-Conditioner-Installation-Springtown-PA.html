<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials.

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
