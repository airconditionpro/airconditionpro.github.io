<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
