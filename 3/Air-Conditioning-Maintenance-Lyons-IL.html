<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Lyons IL</h3>
<p>Specific immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and place signs happen. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the area, for example, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread indoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
