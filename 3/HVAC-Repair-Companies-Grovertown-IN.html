<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
