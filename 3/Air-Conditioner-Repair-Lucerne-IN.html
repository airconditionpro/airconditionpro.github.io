<p>While toxin levels from private sources may not present a substantial health danger by themselves, the majority of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that many people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to prevent new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>To establish a safe assessment or visit with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your area in an online search.
