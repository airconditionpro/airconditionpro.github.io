<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Marion IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
