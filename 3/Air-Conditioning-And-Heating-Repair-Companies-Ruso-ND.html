The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded.
