<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home.
