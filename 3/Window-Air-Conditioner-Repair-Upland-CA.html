<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same).

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
