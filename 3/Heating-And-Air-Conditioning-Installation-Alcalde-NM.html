As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
