<p>Through normal usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may become extremely dirty. These aspects of the devices are crucial for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and examines connections to guarantee they are protected.

<p>The primary reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered.
