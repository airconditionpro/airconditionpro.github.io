<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
