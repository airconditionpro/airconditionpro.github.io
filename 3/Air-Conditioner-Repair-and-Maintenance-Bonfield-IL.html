The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had treated. And mortar manufacturers might decline guarantee coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
