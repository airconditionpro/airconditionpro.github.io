Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
