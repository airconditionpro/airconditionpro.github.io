<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the trouble location in examining the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had changed the expense to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Depending on the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics below may be appropriate.<p>
