<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in New London PA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
