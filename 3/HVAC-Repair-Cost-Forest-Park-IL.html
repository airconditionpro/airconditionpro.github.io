It may likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
