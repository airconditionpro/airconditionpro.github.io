<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
