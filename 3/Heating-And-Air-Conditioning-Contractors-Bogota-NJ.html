Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear extremely complicated at first, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to fret about a thing.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
