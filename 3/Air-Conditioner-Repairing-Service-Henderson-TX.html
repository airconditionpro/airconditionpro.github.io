<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
