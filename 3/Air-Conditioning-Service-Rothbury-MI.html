The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
