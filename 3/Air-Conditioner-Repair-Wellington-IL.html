<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
