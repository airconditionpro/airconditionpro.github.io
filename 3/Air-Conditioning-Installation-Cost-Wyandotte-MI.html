<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Wyandotte Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Wyandotte MI - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit.
