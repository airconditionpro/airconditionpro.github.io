Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
