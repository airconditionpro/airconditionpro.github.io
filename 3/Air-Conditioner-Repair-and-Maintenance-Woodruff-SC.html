<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Climate Pro is reputable and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
