<p>The most underrated HVAC part in your cooling system is the evaporator & condenser coil.

Many air conditioning replacements occur when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. When the copper or aluminum coils begin to rust, refrigerant leakages happen.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
