<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Rehoboth MA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally happen. For the most part, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
