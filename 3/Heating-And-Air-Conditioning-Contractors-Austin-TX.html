<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
