<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Splendora TX</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
