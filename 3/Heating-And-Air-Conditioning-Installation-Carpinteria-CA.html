<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
