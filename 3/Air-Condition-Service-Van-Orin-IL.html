Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear extremely daunting in the beginning, needing specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>

To save energy and cash, you should shop an energy-efficient air conditioning system and decrease your central air conditioner's energy usage. In an average air-conditioned home, air conditioning consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, triggering power plants to release about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
