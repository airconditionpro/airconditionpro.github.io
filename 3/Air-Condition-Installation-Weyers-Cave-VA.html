<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
