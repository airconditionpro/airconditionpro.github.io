<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>The fact is, air contamination in your house can be just as bad - or perhaps worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American costs 87% of their life indoors, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd hear about more frequently. But do not worry!

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>
