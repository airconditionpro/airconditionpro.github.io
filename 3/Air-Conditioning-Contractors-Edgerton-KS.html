<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competition for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>When choosing which of the best AC units they must install in their houses, there are a couple of primary things that house owners will desire to take into factor to consider. It truly depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioning conditioner. The significant elements for the majority of house owners will be the total cost to set up the very best air conditioning unit brand names, life-span of the AC unit, warranties provided, energy efficiency (SEER scores), and size of the unit you need for your home's square footage (LOADS) to effectively cool your home.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
