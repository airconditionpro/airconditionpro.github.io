<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire workplace or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
