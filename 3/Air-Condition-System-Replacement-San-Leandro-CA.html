<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust.

For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
