<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
