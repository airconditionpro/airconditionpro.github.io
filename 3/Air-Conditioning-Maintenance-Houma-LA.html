<p>Air flow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts.

Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>Because they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
