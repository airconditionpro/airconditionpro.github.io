<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
