They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
