<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center.

<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

All quotes (get at least three, from accredited, well-regarded companies) must include this one-page printout.<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to contaminants from bacteria that can grow in big building ventilation systems.
