<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits enable you to avoid the requirement for a complete duct system like a lot of other cooling systems need. You will likewise take pleasure in a a lot more flexible system in terms of installation and cost. And since each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when one person would choose it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
