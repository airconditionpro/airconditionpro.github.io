<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that periodically turns up. When you do discover your furnace acting strangely, it is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you react to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the issue worse, and often more expensive.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources.

Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing devices, but likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those elements may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>

It likewise means you will be dusting off your air conditioning system and running it on an almost daily basis. Like a lot of Washington entrepreneur, you probably haven't used your cooling system since the last time the weather was warm, and so a quick check to ensure everything remains in order is a good idea.<p>
