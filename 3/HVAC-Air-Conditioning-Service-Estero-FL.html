<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
