<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

When inspecting your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, constantly make sure.
