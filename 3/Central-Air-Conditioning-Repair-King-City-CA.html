This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.
