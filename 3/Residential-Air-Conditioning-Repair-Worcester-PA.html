<p>Remember that the SEER rating is determined using the very same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer season temperature to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to get to the correct SEER score for your area, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
