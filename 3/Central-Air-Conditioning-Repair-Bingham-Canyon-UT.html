COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
