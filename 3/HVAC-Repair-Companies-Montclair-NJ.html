It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
