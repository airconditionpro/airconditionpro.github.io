<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
