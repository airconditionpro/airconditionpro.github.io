<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a cruel, vicious summer.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are managed in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a threat just. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>
