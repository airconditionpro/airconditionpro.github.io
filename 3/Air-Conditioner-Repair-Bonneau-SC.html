<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
