<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Dunstable MA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
