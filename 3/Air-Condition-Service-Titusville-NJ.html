<p>Particular instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically difficult to determine if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to take notice of the time and location symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the location, for instance, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
