<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
