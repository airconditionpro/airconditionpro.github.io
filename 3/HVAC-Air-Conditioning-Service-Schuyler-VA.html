<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
