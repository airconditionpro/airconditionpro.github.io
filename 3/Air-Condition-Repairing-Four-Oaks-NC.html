<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern.
