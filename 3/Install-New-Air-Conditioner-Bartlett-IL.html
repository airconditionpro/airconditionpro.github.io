<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.
