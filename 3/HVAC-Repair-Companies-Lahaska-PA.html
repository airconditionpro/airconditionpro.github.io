Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires dealt with by experts, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
