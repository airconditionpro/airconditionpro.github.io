<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed concerns. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until many years after direct exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought home from task websites.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
