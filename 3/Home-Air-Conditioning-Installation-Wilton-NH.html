In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
