<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
