This step is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

Comparable data is not offered for long-term, low-level direct exposures to a mix of contaminants as is the case for IAQ problems. Presently, there is not enough information offered to anticipate the effects of exposure to a number of possibly damaging agents at the very same time.<p>
