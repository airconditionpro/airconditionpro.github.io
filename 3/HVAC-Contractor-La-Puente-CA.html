<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
