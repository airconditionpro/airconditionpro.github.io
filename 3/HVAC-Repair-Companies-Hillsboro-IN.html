In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens.
