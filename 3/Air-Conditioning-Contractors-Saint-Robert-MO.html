<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, unpredictable natural substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and making use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in the majority of structures. Residential units can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
