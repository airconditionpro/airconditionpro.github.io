<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
