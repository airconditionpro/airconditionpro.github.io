CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
