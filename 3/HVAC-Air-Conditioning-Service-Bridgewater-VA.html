They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
