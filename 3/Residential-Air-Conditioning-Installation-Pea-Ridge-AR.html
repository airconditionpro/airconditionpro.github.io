<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts.
