<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue.

The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
