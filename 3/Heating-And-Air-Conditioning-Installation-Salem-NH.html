<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me.
