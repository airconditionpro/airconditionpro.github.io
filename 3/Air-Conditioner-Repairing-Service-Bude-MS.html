<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really well-informed. Expenses are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. Since the cost was undoubtedly affordable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
