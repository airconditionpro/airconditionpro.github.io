<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
