<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
