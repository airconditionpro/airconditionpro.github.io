<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard.

DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t effectively identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
