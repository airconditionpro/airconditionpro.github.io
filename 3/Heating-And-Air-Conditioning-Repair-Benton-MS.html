<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The heatpump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from numerous sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, however with enhancements in low temperature level operation and reduced loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.<p>
<p>In general, they tend to require less energy than other type of heating, and they're reasonably comfy, not striking you with an unexpected rise of heat.
