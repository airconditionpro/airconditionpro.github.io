<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level.

While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
<p>If you want to conserve yourself money and time over the long term, having actually annual maintenance performed on the furnace is an excellent concept.
