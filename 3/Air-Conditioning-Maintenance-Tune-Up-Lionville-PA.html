<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
