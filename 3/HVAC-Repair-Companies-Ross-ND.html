What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
