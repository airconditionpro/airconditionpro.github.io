<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re assess and minimize the energy load of the home. A more energy effective house will not only minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility bills, but it will greatly improve the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements usually consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest a number of qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for references.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the problem and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one.
