So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
