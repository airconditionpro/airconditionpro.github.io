<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Do not put it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
