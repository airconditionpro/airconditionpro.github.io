<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
