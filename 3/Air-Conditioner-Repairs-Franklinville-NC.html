<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
