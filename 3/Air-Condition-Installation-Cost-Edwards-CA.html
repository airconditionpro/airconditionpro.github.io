<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
