Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump work on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the very same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

To put it simply, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort.
