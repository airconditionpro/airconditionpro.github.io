<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
