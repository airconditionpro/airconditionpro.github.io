<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
