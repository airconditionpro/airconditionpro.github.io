Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
