<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
