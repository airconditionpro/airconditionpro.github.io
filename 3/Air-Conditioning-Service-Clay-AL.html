<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
