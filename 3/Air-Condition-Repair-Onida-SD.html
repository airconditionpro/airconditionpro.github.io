<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Onida SD</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went on and bought this Carrier and I must state it does the job rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
