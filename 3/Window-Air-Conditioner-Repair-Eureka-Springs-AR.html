<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>

Transmitting heat through solid objects will also trigger it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house warmed by a radiant system will heat up much faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
