<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers.
