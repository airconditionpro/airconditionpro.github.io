<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furniture, flooring and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
