<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance.

As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>The exhaust outlets permit all unsafe gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can cause a hazardous accumulation and compromise your safety. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack also. They will search for indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
