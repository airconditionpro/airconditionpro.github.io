<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
