<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of illness caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
