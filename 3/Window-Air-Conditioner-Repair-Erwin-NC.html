<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your house.

During the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision.
