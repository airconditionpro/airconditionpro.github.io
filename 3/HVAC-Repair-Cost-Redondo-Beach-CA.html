<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
