<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Fort Wayne Indiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
