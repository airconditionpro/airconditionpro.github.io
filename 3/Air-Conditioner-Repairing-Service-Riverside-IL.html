<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>The people operating at Target aren't dumb or lazy and in this organisation all it takes is one tiny crack in your protections and somebody will discover it and pry you broad open, sometimes in simply a few days.

This is no longer the world of the only hacker but rather worldwide, the mob and they are far better funded and staffed than any of us could ever be.<p>
