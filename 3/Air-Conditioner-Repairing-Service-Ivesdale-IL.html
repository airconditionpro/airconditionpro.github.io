<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
