<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Likewise they identified the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
