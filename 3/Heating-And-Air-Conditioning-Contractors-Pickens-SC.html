<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Pickens SC</h3>
<p>You're motivating the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
