<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
