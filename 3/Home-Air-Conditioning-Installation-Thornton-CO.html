<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
