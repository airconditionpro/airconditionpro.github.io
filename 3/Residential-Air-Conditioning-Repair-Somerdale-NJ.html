<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
