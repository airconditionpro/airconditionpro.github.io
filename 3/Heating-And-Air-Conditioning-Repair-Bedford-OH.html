<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Bedford OH</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
