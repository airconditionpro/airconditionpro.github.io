However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
