<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
