<p>If it's time to upgrade an aging AC, variable speed is the way to go. Already preparing to change an existing ac system? Assuming your budget accommodates a variable speed unit, you should absolutely get one! You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summer season, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner. At least, consider a 2 stage compressor for enhanced convenience and efficiency.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
