HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
