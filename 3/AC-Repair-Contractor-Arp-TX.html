<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
