<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
