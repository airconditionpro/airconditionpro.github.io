The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
