<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Birdsboro Pennsylvania</h3>

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from task sites.<p>
