<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
