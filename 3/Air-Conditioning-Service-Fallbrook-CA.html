<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
