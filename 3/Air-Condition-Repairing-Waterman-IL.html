<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
