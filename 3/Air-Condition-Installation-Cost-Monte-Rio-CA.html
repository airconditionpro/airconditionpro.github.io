<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same.
