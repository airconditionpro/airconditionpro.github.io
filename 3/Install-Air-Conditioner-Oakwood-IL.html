<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
