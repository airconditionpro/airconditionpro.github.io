<h3>HVAC Company in Ashford Washington</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>In a lot of cases, if products have stopped working to dry a number of days after the suspected water occasion, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not instantly visible.

In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold removal might be needed. Mold screening and evaluations should be performed by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate outcomes; complimentary mold testing offered by removal companies is not suggested.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
