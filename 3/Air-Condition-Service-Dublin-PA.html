<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
