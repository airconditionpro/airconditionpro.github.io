<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
