<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these people twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
