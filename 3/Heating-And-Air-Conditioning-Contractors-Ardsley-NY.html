<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Ardsley NY - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Ardsley NY</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
