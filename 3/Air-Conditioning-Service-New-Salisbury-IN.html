<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years.
