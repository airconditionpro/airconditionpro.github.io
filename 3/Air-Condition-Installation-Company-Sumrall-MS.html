<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Sumrall Mississippi</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
