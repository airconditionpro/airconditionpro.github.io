<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal business.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
