<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Harned KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower total temperature-- in some cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating system." In other words, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
