<p>Plan on spending several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
