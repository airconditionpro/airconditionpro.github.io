<p>The exhaust outlets permit all unsafe gases to escape your property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your safety. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will look for signs of deterioration, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>A lot of respectable HVAC technicians will use totally free estimates with an in-person service call. Be careful of HVAC contractors who attempt to offer you a free quote over the phone, as it might not accurately reflect what they will discover as soon as they take a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost price quote, that quantity will usually be used towards your balance due, should you decide to work with that contractor.<p>
