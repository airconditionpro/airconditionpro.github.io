<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
