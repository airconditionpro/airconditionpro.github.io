<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>A business plan for an HVAC company can't remain stagnant if that service is to prosper. You can't simply develop your organisation plan and then forget it.
