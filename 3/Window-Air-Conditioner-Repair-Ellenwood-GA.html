<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy issue like particles clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Ellenwood GA</h3>
<p>I was very happy in the start because things ran smoothly without any sound. Furthermore, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical energy bills. After 2 years, things started to change. There have been awkward noises. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
