<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
