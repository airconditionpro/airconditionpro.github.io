<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
