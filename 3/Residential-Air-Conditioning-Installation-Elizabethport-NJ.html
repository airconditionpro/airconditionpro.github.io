<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
