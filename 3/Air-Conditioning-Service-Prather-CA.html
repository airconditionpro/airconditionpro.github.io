<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Prather CA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is poorly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
