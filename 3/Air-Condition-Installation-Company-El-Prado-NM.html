<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
