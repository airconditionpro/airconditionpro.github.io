<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
