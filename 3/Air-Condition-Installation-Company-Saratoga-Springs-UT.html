<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
