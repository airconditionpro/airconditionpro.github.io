<h3>Heater Repair in Prospect OR</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
