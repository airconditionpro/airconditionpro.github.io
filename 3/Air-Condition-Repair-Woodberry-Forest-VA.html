<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
