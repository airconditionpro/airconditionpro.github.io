While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
