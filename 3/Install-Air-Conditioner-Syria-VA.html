<p>While contaminant levels from specific sources might not present a significant health threat on their own, the majority of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from happening.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a producer's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
