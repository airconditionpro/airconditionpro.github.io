<h3>Truth About Playa Del Rey CA Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
