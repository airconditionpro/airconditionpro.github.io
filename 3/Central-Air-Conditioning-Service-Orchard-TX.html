<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
