<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and reliable  technique to minimize ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
