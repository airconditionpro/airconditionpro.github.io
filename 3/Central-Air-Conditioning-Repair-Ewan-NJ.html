<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
