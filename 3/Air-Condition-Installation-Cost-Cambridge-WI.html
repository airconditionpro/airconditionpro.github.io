<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
