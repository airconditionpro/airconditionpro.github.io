In a circumstance where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold remediation may be required.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
