<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
