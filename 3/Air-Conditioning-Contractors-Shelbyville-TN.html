<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My spouse said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>

Never use a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
