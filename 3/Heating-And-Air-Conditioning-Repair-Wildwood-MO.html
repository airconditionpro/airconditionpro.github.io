<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and straightforward method to decrease ambient air contamination and possible health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
