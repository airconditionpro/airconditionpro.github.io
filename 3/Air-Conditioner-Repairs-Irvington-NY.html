<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your furnace quits working, begin by calling RJ Heating. We often discover that a basic repair or adjustment is all that's required to assist it run correctly again. Much more typically, our customers are surprised that we more than happy to repair a furnace instead of attempting to sell them a brand-new one.
