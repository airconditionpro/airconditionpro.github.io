According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot.
