<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can take to choose items that will prevent indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here.
