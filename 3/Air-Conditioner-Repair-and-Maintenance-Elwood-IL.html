<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
