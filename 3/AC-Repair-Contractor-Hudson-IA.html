For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home.

Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
