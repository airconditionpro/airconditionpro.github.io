<p>There are a great deal of advantages to using a radiant heating system over a standard forced air heater. Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heating units, for one thing. Forced air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leakages, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output. Forced air heater also tend to produce hot and cold spots throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>
