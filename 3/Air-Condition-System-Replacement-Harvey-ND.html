<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
