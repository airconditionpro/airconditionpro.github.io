<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
