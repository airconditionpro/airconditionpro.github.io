<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
