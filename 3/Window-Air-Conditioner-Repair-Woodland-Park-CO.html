<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
