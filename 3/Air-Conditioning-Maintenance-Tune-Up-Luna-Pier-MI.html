<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
