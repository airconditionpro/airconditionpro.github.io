<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
