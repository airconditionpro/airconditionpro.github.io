<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My better half said that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have met in a long time.
