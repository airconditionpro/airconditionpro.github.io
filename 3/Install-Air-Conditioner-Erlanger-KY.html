<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.
