Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer agreements.  The so called trusted companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night clothing. I know since I attempted to work for them. Because 90% of them are criminals, I quit. They walk in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you don't need. They lie.
