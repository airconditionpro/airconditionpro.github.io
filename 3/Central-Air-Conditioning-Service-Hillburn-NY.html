<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>It is not useful to develop a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health due to the fact that immunity differs greatly from individual to specific. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a 10 year research study analyzing more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples evaluated were tested positive for fungi and germs.<p>
