In the summer season, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature stays continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide reputable and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or typical household air conditioning unit does.
