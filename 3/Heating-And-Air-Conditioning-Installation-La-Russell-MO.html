<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
