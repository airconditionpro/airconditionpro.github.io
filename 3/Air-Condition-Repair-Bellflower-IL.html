<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
