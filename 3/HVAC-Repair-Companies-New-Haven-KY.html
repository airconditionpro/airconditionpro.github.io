<h3>Electric Heating Systems in New Haven Kentucky</h3>

Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
