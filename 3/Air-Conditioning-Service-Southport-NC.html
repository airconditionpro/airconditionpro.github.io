<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
