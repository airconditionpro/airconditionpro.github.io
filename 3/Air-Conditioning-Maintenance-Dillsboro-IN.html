<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
