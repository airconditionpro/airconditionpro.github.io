<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
