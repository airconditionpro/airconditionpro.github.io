While weatherization is underway, however, steps ought to also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals ought to be alert to the emergence of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be carried out up until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation area of air conditioning unit, several primary aspects need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there should not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside unit must likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is highly a good idea to set up the a/c systems in easily accessible locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
