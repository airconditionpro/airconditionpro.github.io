<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, particularly considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration.

The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
