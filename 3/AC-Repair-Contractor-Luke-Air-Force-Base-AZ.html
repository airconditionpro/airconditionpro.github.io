<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
