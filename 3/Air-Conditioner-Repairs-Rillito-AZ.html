<p>For instance, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a method that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house.
