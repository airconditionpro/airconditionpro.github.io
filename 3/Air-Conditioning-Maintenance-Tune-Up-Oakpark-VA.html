<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation service completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a service or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty will not do you any great need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and employ a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
