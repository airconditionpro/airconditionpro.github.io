<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home lies, the local region's environment can change significantly.

A house in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capability also which will impact expenses.
