<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.

I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
