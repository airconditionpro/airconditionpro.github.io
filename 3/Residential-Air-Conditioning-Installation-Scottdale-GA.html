This is normally used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
