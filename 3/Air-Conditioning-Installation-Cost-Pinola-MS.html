<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Environment Pro is dependable and truly cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
