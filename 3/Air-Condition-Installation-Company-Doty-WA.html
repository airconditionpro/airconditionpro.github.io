There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company.

Review of this information may recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
