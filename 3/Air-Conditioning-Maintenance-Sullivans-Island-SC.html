<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
