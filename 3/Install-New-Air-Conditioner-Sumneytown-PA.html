<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task might require completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can also vary significantly, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. Sometimes, entirely brand-new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
