<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece beside the house's foundation. This kind of ac system also is utilized in little commercial structures.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
