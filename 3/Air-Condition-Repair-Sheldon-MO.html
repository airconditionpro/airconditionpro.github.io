<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used.

Nevertheless, some makers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
