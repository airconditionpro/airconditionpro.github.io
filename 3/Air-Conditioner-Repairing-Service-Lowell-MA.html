He clearly and thoroughly discussed all issues and fixes in a way that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to an issue that could not be dealt with on the first visit due to unavailable parts.

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
