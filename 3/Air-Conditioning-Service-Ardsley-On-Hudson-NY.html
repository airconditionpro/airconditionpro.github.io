<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
