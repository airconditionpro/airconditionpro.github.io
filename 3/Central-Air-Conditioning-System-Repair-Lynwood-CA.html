<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My other half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us.
