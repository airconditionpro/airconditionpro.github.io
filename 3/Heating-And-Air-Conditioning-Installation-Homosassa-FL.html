<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Homosassa FL</h3>
<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will vary extensively from dealership to dealer, for a number of reasons. Some dealers will be provide a more extensive service with specified efficiency warranties, while others may do a more fundamental service at a special rate to generate new organisation. Both approaches can yield the desired outcome of keeping your furnace heating system performing well as long as the service is supplied by a reputable HVAC contractor. A Carrier ® furnace dealer can quickly and easily provide you a quote for heating unit service and get you set up for your yearly maintenance.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
