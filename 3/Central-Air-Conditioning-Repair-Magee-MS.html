<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans must be set up in all kitchen areas and restrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most efficient fans are quiet and long lasting. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an adequate amount of time. A good rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
