<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings.

You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
