Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
