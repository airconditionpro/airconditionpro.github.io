<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
