<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
