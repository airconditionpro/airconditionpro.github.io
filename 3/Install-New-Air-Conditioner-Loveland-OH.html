AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>The fact is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
