Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
