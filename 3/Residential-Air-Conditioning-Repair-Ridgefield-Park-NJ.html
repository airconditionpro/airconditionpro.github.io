<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
