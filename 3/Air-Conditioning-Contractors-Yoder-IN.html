<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will have to work more difficult and might overheat. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
