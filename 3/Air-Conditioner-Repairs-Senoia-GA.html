<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
