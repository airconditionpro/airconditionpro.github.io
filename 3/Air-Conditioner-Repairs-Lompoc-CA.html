<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
