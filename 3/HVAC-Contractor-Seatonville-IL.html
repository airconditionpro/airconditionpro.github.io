<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
