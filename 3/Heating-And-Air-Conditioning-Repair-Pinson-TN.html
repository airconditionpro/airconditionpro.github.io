<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J estimation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house likewise depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In numerous split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The a/c's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heat pump.
