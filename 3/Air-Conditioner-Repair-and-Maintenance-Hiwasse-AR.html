<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
