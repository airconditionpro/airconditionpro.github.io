<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
