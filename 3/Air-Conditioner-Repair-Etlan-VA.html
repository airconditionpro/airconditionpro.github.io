<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
