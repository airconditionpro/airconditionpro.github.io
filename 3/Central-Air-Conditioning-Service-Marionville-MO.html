<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives usually total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building and construction (homes normally utilize in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
