Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor.

Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.
