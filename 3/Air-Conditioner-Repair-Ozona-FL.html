<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
