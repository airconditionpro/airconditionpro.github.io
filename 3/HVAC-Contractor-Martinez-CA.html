<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting details on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may notice moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
