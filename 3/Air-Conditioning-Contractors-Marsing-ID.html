<p>To set up a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing technicians in your location in an online search. Message or call service technicians to ask whether they can perform an assessment over the phone or perhaps over a video call. This way, they can assess the problem without increasing the threat of virus transmission by visiting your house.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to deal with the circumstance immediately.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate problems-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies listed below might be proper.<p>
