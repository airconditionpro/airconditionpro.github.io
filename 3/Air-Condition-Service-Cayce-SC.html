No additional charge.<p>

<p>A third method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
