Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow limitation will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
