The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
