<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
