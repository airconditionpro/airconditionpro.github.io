The coronavirus outbreak is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as hospitals work to mitigate the spread of illness and workplaces, retail, and education centers are thinking about methods to resume safely and lessen infection.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
