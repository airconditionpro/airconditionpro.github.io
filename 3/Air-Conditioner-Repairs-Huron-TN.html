<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
