<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in houses.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
