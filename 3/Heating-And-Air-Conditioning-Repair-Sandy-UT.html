ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
