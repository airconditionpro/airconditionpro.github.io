<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to enhance their look, performance, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even drastically change structures in manner ins which might be essential to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the methods utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become blocked, minimizing air circulation quality, volume, and circulation. They also may become locations for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be effectively kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
