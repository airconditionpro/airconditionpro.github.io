<p>New air conditioning system generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking implies greater energy efficiency and possibly lower energy bills. A great SEER ranking for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally enabled SEER rating is going to be much more energy effective than your existing, old a/c unit. It's not constantly about selecting the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size air conditioning unit is a crucial part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to help you with. Here's why purchasing the best size a/c matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll wind up wasting cash and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>Firstly, The after hours addressing service representative, John, was extremely polite and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, educated technician. He was at my house within the time he provided me, repaired the problem while describing the concern then stayed several minutes to make certain it was working effectively. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I have actually never seen prior to while being a house owner for ten years. I also advise one of the Protection Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
