<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
