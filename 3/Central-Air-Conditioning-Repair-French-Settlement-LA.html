<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
