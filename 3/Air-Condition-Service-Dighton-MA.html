<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the total system if you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house.

In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
