<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
