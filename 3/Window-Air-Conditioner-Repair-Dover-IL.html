<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
