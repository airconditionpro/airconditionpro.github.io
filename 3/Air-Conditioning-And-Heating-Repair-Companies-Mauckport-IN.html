<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
