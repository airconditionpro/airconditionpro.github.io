<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
