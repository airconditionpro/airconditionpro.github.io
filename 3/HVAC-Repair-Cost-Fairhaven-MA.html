These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only factor for high expenses. Furnaces typically lose their effectiveness as they age, specifically if they have actually not been effectively kept.
