Each room in the home has possible asthma sets off. Some issues can be repaired rapidly, but others might need more time and work to manage or get rid of asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and fragrances, add to indoor air contamination and have been known to asthma signs in sensitive people.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
