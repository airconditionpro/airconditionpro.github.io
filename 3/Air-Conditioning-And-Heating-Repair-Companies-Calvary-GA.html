<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
