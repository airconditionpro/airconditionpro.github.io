<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on.
