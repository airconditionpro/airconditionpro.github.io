<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
