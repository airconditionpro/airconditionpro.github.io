<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A trained technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your a/c unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.
