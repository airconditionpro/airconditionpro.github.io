<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
