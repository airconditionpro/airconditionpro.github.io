<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
