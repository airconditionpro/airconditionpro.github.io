<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
