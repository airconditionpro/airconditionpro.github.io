<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Rogers MN</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
