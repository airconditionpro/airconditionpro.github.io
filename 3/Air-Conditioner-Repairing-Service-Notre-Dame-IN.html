<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
