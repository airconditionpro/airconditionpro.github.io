<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
