<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Clear Lake MN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
